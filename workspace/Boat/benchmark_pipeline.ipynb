        "\n",
        "The US has agreed on a $2tn stimulus package, the largest economic stimulus in US history, in response to the economic impacts of Covid-19. While corporations will be the biggest recipients of the bailout, some of that money will be paid directly to Americans hit by the pandemic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most taxpayers will get a check in the mail, while those directly affected by the economic effects of Covid-19 are slated to receive robust government support.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s what we know so far about how the new stimulus package will directly affect Americans in the coming weeks:\n",
        "\n",
        "Who’s eligible for a check from the government?\n",
        "\n",
        "Congress will spend about $250bn for checks up to $1,200 per person that will go directly to taxpayers.\n",
        "\n",
        "To be eligible for the full amount, a person’s most recently filed tax return must show that they made $75,000 or under. For couples, who can receive a maximum of $2,400, the cutoff is $150,000.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a person makes more than $75,000, the amount given goes down incrementally by $5 for every $100 increase in salary. So a person who makes $85,000 would get $700 while a person who makes $95,000 would get $200.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a person makes above $99,000, or a couple makes above $198,000, no check will be given.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are some requirements and exceptions. Those getting a check must be living and working in the US and have a valid social security number. If a person is listed as a dependent on their parents’ tax return – the case for many college students – they are excluded.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Tax Foundation, a DC-based thinktank, estimates that 93.6% of Americans will be eligible for a check coming from the stimulus package.\n",
        "\n",
        "What about parents?\n",
        "\n",
        "Taxpayers will be given $500 per child 16 or under listed as a dependent on their latest tax return.\n",
        "\n",
        "When will I get this money?\n",
        "\n",
        "That is still unclear. Experts say that Americans will probably not get the money until May, given how long it takes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to send out checks. The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said those whose bank account information is already with the IRS from previous tax returns can expect a payment “within three weeks”.\n",
        "\n",
        "For those who still need to give the IRS their bank account information, a web-based portal will be opening soon to allow people to provide the IRS with their information. The IRS says this is to make sure people get their checks immediately, instead of sending them through the mail.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is not the first time the government has sent checks to Americans. The federal government gave up to $300 in 2001 and $600 in 2008 to taxpayers who met a certain income bracket to similarly stimulate the economy.\n",
        "\n",
        "What if a person did not file their 2018 or 2019 return?\n",
        "\n",
        "The IRS recommends people file their 2018 or 2019 tax return as soon as possible to get the payment. A check will be sent to any qualified person so long as they file their return within 2020.\n",
        "\n",
        "What if a person does not file their taxes?\n",
        "\n",
        "A person may still be eligible even if they do not file the taxes. The IRS says people who typically do not file taxes – low-income taxpayers and some veterans – will need to file a “simple tax return” in order to get the payment. Social security beneficiaries will not need to fill out the tax return, even if they do not file their taxes, to get the payment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Does the package help unemployed workers?\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, specifically the bill will increase unemployment insurance by $600 for 13 weeks – about four months – for every person, added to the existing unemployment compensation a person gets from their state’s program.\n",
        "\n",
        "The length and amount of compensation varies from state to state. A majority of states providing a maximum of 26 weeks of compensation, while average weekly compensation ranges from 20% of a person’s wage to just over 50%.\n",
        "\n",
        "What about freelance and gig workers?\n",
        "\n",
        "While unemployment insurance typically does not cover people who are self-employed – freelancers, contractors and gig workers – the bill comes with a “pandemic unemployment assistance” measure that will extend insurance to those workers.\n",

        "Play Video 2:25 'The universe is collapsing': Bernie Sanders mocks Republicans over coronavirus aid – video\n",
        "\n",
        "Have there been any changes to paid leave?\n",
        "\n",
        "Not in this bill. Earlier last week, Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, a bill worth about $100bn meant to expand paid sick leave and emergency paid leave, but it came with major loopholes. Companies with over 500 employees were not mentioned in the bill, while companies with under 50 employees can apply for exemptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The bill mandates 10 days of fully paid sick leave for employees of companies with 500 employees or less. Parents of those companies affected by their children’s school closing and those leaving for medical reasons can get 12 weeks of pay at 67% of their salary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Will there be anything to offset healthcare costs related to Covid-19?\n",
        "\n",
        "Again, not in this bill. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act included a measure that mandated all Covid-19 testing is free, but treatment for any symptoms (there is currently no cure for the illness) still comes at a cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "A few states have reopened enrollment for their health insurance programs to allow those concerned about costs to enroll, and three major health insurance companies said they will be waiving any high costs for treatment, but there are still stories of people getting bills for as much as $34,000 to cover treatment of the virus’s symptoms.\n",

But other changes , affecting health policy domestically and abroad , are moving ahead with far less attention .\\nUnder the direction of two secretaries recommended by Pence , the Department of Health and Human Services has moved to slash funds from teen pregnancy-prevention programs , curb abortion both in the United States and abroad and strip civil protections for transgender patients .\\nThe administration has emphasized abstinence programs , led by appointees who believe contraception harms women , and pushed to cut government funds for Planned Parenthood \\u2013 a longtime cause for Pence while he was in Congress . Planned Parenthood , a national network of healthcare providers , offers infertility services , contraception and abortions .\\nPublic health civil rights offices , marshaled to strengthen LGBT rights under Obama , have been retooled into a new Office of Conscience and Religious Freedom . This month , the office unveiled a final \\u201c conscience rule \\u201d to strengthen protections for healthcare workers who object to performing abortions and sterilizations or treating gay and transgender patients .\\nAnd the HHS , along with the State Department \\u2013 headed by Pence ally Mike Pompeo , also an evangelical Christian \\u2013 has expanded the campaign beyond U.S. borders . Trump-appointed officials are seeking to delete language in international documents at the United Nations they contend promotes access to abortion and expands healthcare rights to transgender individuals .\\n\\u201c There has never been anything like it , \\u201d Marjorie Dannenfelser , president of the Susan B. Anthony List , an anti-abortion group , said of her working relationship with Pence . \\u201c The policy I believe can \\u2019 t get done without Vice President Pence and his team . \\u201d\\nA cadre of religious conservatives appointed in the early days of the administration is driving the changes , largely from within HHS , which administers most government health programs , along with the State Department and White House . Many appointees come from religious and conservative groups , some of whom regularly protested outside abortion clinics during the Obama years .\\nIn the Trump-Pence West Wing , \\u201c everywhere I turn are colleagues , mentors and friends who have fought in the pro-life trenches for decades , \\u201d Katy Talento , who handled health policy in the White House , told an anti-abortion group in Texas . She last week announced plans to leave the administration . \\u201c I still can \\u2019 t believe they let us all in the complex every day . \\u201d\\nEmboldened by the movement and by the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court , states including Alabama and Missouri have passed laws in recent weeks that nearly outlaw abortion , spurring nationwide protests .\\nThe shift has generated legal challenges , and chunks of the agenda are bottlenecked in the courts . Recently , a federal judge in Washington State blocked new rules meant to cut funding from facilities offering abortion .\\nThe campaign has been more successful abroad .

It created a split screen for the ages , with his critics saying the president was deepening divisions at a time when leadership was crucial to help unify a fractured country .\\nThe president \\u2019 s forceful turn to a partisan posture was reminiscent of the us-vs.-them rhetoric he has often used when under pressure , including in the face of the coronavirus pandemic . He has responded to the violence with a string of polarizing tweets , one starkly laying out the political stakes by underscoring the approach of Election Day .\\nTrump vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America \\u2019 s own cities to quell a rise of violent protests , including ransacking stores and burning police cars . He offered little recognition of the anger coursing through the country as he demanded a harsher crackdown on the mayhem that has erupted following the death of George Floyd .\\nFloyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed his neck with his knee as the man pleaded that he couldn \\u2019 t breathe . Violent demonstrations have raged in dozens of cities across the nation , marking a level of widespread turmoil unseen for decades .\\nThe political ground beneath Trump has greatly shifted in the spring of this election year . He was supposed to be running on a strong economy , but now he \\u2019 s facing a pandemic , an economic collapse and civil unrest not seen since the 1960s .\\nIndeed , some around the president likened the moment to 1968 , when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots and captured the White House . But Trump is the incumbent and , despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider , he risks being held responsible for the violence .\\nTrump emerged after two days out of public view in the White House to threaten to deploy \\u201c thousands and thousands \\u201d of U.S. troops . Then he made a surprise walk through Lafayette Park to a Washington house of worship known as \\u201c The Church of the Presidents \\u201d that suffered fire damage in the protests .\\nThat brought a quick condemnation from Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde .\\n\\u201c The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for , \\u201d she said . But he had his campaign moment .\\n\\u201c Most of you are weak , \\u201d he said . \\u201c It \\u2019 s like a war . And we will end it fast . Be tough . \\u201d\\n\\u201c You have to dominate \\u201d and \\u201c if you don \\u2019 t dominate you \\u2019 re wasting your time , \\u201d Trump said , demanding the protests be swiftly crushed , even as some warned that such an aggressive law enforcement response could lead to an escalation of violence .\\nThe president urged governors to make more use of the National Guard , which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis . He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence , including New York , Philadelphia and Los Angeles .\\n\\u201c You \\u2019 re going to arrest all those people and you \\u2019 re going to try them . And if they get five years or 10 years , they have to get five years or 10 years , \\u201d the president said . \\u201c So I say that , and the winners dominate . \\u201d\\nTrump \\u2019 s exhortations came after a night of escalating violence , with images of chaos overshadowing largely peaceful protests . The disturbances grew so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground White House bunker previously used during terrorist attacks .\\nSome West Wing officials and political advisers have acknowledged that some of the president \\u2019 s tweets have not been helpful , and they have been pushing Trump to acknowledge the pain of the peaceful protesters without lumping them in with the agitators he says are responsible for the violence .\\nBut another faction within the administration , including longtime law-and-order proponent Attorney General William Barr , has encouraged Trump \\u2019 s instincts to focus on the group violence . The hope is such a posture can help Trump draw a contrast with Democrats who have been less vocal in their condemnation of the unrest .\\nThe West Wing had been mostly empty over the weekend . Many staffers were told to stay home to avoid the protests , chief of staff Mark Meadows was out of town celebrating his daughter \\u2019 s wedding and senior adviser Jared Kushner was marking a Jewish holiday .\\nAmong the options being discussed in the White House : a new criminal justice reform package , a task force that would include Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and a listening tour of African American communities , according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because nothing had been finalized .\\n\\u201c Hate just hides . It doesn \\u2019 t go away , and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks , it comes out from under the rocks , \\u201d said the party \\u2019 s presumptive presidential nominee , former Vice President Joe Biden , speaking at a church in Wilmington , Delaware .\\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump \\u201c struggles to summon even an ounce of humanity in this time of turmoil . \\u201d\\n\\u201c The president has reacted to the pain and anger in the country by playing politics and encouraging police to be tougher on protesters by bragging about his reelection prospects and his personal safety inside the White House , \\u201d Schumer said .\\nLong drawn to displays of strength , Trump and his advisers believe that the combative rhetoric and promises to send the military into cities will reassure voters , including senior citizens and suburban women , concerned by the lawlessness .\\nEager to change the narrative of the election , just five months away , from a referendum on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic , Trump and his aides see a cultural war issue that could captivate his base .\\nRalph Reed , chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition and a close ally of the president , said , \\u201c In the same way that he became the unlikeliest of champions for evangelicals and the faith community , he has it in him to do the same thing for the minority community . \\u201d\\nMuch as he has with the pandemic , Trump has tried to scapegoat the nation \\u2019 s Democratic governors and mayors , much to their dismay .\\nDuring the teleconference , Illinois Gov .

President Obama defeated 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney by double digits among female voters .\\nBoehner and other top Republican leaders have acknowledged that the party needs to do a better job addressing the concerns of women . Some high profile gaffes from GOP Senate candidates in 2012 caused blowback among female voters . Missouri GOP Senate candidate Todd Akin referred to `` legitimate rape '' and Richard Mourdock in Indiana suggested rape was `` something God intended to happen . '' Both red-state candidates were favored to win but lost badly .\\nLast month Boehner admitted , `` Some of our members just are n't as sensitive as they ought to be . ''\\nThe House GOP campaign arm is working with male candidates to improve their messaging to women this election cycle .\\nRepublican leaders released a video showing McMorris Rodgers getting her kids ready in the morning , discussing working in her father 's family owned agriculture business and touting that she was the first child in her family to graduate from college .\\nBut the real focus in McMorris Rodgers ' story is her family . Her son Cole was born in 2007 , and has Down syndrome . Her daughter Grace arrived in December 2010 , while the Washington State Congresswoman served as vice chair of the House GOP Conference , marking the first time a member of House leadership delivered a baby . Her second daughter , Brynn Catherine , arrived in late November . She is married to Brian Rodgers , who is a retired Navy officer .\\nAddressing the camera in the short biographical video clip , McMorris Rodgers says her son 's diagnosis with Down 's syndrome has made her `` a better legislator and a better person '' and said her focus in Congress is to make sure the next generation has as many or more opportunities than she does .\\nAs the chair of the House Republican conference , McMorris Rodgers is tasked with communicating the public message for House GOP members .

But other changes, affecting health policy domestically and abroad, are moving ahead with far less attention.\\n\\nUnder the direction of two secretaries recommended by Pence, the Department of Health and Human Services has moved to slash funds from teen pregnancy-prevention programs, curb abortion both in the United States and abroad and strip civil protections for transgender patients.\\n\\nThe administration has emphasized abstinence programs, led by appointees who believe contraception harms women, and pushed to cut government funds for Planned Parenthood \\u2013 a longtime cause for Pence while he was in Congress. Planned Parenthood, a national network of healthcare providers, offers infertility services, contraception and abortions.\\n\\nPublic health civil rights offices, marshaled to strengthen LGBT rights under Obama, have been retooled into a new Office of Conscience and Religious Freedom.

Missouri GOP Senate candidate Todd Akin referred to \\\"legitimate rape\\\" and Richard Mourdock in Indiana suggested rape was \\\"something God intended to happen.\\\" Both red-state candidates were favored to win but lost badly.\\n\\nLast month Boehner admitted, \\\"Some of our members just aren't as sensitive as they ought to be.\\\"\\n\\nThe House GOP campaign arm is working with male candidates to improve their messaging to women this election cycle.\\n\\nRepublican leaders released a video showing McMorris Rodgers getting her kids ready in the morning, discussing working in her father's family owned agriculture business and touting that she was the first child in her family to graduate from college.\\n\\nBut the real focus in McMorris Rodgers' story is her family. Her son Cole was born in 2007, and has Down syndrome. Her daughter Grace arrived in December 2010, while the Washington State Congresswoman served as vice chair of the House GOP Conference, marking the first time a member of House leadership delivered a baby. Her second daughter, Brynn Catherine, arrived in late November. She is married to Brian Rodgers, who is a retired Navy officer.\\n\\nAddressing the camera in the short biographical video clip, McMorris Rodgers says her son's diagnosis with Down's syndrome has made her \\\"a better legislator and a better person\\\" and said her focus in Congress is to make sure the next generation has as many or more opportunities than she does.\\n\\nAs the chair of the House Republican conference, McMorris Rodgers is tasked with communicating the public message for House GOP members. Since taking over the position last January she has made a major push for her colleagues to make Twitter and Facebook a big part of their communications strategies.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"www.dailycaller.com\",\n          \"www.bbc.com\",\n          \"www.breitbart.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bias_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"right\",\n          \"left\",\n          \"center\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ID\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1299,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"GD83xT6AfNWKsnkY\",\n          \"W5xVE5Xh9MYRMRaU\",\n          \"QHBUBAEBDI4dfdXg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_bias_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.7979907105243653,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 2.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5,\n          1.5,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_encoded\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 9.089248055063528,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 28.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 28,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6.0,\n          17.0,\n          14.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"avg_sentence_bias_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22769259748565643,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 607,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6868686868686869,\n          0.4417177914110429,\n          0.2258064516129032\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
