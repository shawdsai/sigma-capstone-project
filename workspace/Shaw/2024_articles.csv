This marks not only the first time he has ever come close to majority support, but also only the second time since the end of the Cold War that a Republican presidential candidate has won the popular vote.

""Of the counties with nearly complete results, more than 90 percent shifted in favor of former President Donald J. Trump in the 2024 presidential election,"" The New York Times found on the morning after the election. ""Early results showed that even a number of states where Vice President Kamala Harris was ahead had shifted right.""

""Trump picked up more votes in every state apart from Utah and Washington,"" added the Financial Times. ""Across the US, the data suggests women, urban voters and the Latino vote did not come through for Harris, while rural areas came out strong for Trump.""

With the U.S. Senate also lost and the House very much in peril, Democrats may find themselves in the wilderness yet again. But what lessons will they take from this experience in electoral repudiation? For that matter, will they learn anything?

It's not a foregone conclusion that they will: In the three elections in which Trump has competed, Democrats largely treated him as an existential threat, making a case for his inherent unfitness for office but often forgetting to mount a positive campaign for themselves. And then, after losing to him in 2016—even after beating him in 2020—the party did no apparent soul-searching to determine why voters would pick such an unfit candidate.

Ironically, it's a lesson they could learn from Republicans. In 2012, after losing two presidential elections in a row, Republicans conducted a ""full autopsy"" on the moribund party and its electoral failures, hoping to determine how to appeal to voters going forward. To compile the report, which was released the following year, the panel conducted conference calls, online surveys, focus groups, and more than 3,000 ""group listening sessions.""

Democrats, on the other hand, did no such self-inquiry when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. ""Democrats didn't even attempt to do an autopsy in the wake of 2016, relegating debates about the party's future to places like Twitter and cable news,"" wrote Jon Favreau, a progressive commentator and former speechwriter for President Barack Obama.

That may not be entirely true. In fact, Democrats tasked then-Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D–N.Y.) with compiling an autopsy of the 2016 election, only to then effectively bury it: Maloney presented the report to lawmakers ""during a members-only gathering at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee headquarters"" in 2017, Politico reported, but ""members were not allowed to have copies of the report and may view it only under the watchful eyes of DCCC staff.""

Clinton herself conceded defeat but apparently never quite accepted it. In the months after the election, she blamed her loss on sexism, Russian hacks, then-FBI Director James Comey's late-October announcement that the bureau had reopened its investigation into her use of a private email server…but never herself or her campaign.

True, none of those explanations is without merit. But Russian hackers did not keep Clinton from ever visiting Wisconsin during the general campaign, and Comey's letter did not enable Trump to turn out ""a flood of rural and small-town working class voters"" in Pennsylvania, as William A. Galston of the Brookings Institute wrote.

Even the 2020 election, when Joe Biden beat Trump by more than 7 million votes, provided an opportunity for reflection. ""Democrats…are entitled to a temporary feeling of triumphalism,"" Ross K. Baker wrote in January 2021, ""but there is also cause for them do some reflection on how they should reach out to the tens of millions of voters who rejected them and who are sullen and even rebellious.""

Instead, Democrats reacted as if Trump was a comic book supervillain they had banished back to his home planet, never to return.

""Relax, A Trump Comeback In 2024 Is Not Going To Happen,"" read the headline of a December 2020 piece by Politico's John Harris. ""The Trump years were not just a hallucination,"" Harris wrote. ""But chances are they will soon enough come to feel like they were — which won't leave much opportunity to return to real power.""

""Donald Trump will never be allowed to step foot in the Capitol again,"" Lawrence O'Donnell proclaimed on his MSNBC show, days after the incursion on January 6. ""Never. Unless he insists on testifying in his own defense in his Senate second impeachment trial.""

Indeed, the Capitol riot likely should have marked the end of Trump's political career: Even setting aside his potential culpability, his behavior during the violence sufficiently demonstrated his unfitness for any future returns to the White House.

But given that both Democrats and Republicans failed to convict in his Senate impeachment trial, the only way to keep him from office was to defeat him at the ballot box. Instead, Democrats apparently took Trump's unfitness as so manifestly self-evident that it was not worth interrogating why 74 million people voted for him in 2020, and whether they would do so again.

To be clear, an autopsy by itself can't turn a party's prospects around. One of the GOP report's top-line recommendations was that the party should be more amenable to immigrants, specifically from Latin America: ""If Hispanics think we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies."" Some Republicans were open to it: Just two days after the 2012 election, Fox News host Sean Hannity told his radio audience he had ""evolved on"" immigration, advocating ""a pathway"" to citizenship ""for those people that are here.""

The punchline, of course, is that in the very next election, the party nominated Trump, who began his campaign by calling Mexicans ""rapists"" and pledging to build a wall on the southern border.

But ironically, Trump's electoral successes have included increasing his share of Hispanic voters: Trump won nearly 30 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2016, which rose to 32 percent in 2020 and an estimated 46 percent in 2024.

A Democratic autopsy of the 2024 election would therefore ask why nearly half of all Hispanic voters would choose Trump over Harris—along with increasing numbers of nearly every other demographic group.

Even at this early juncture, possible explanations abound. Inflation, resulting from COVID-19 pandemic policy and exacerbated by Biden-era spending bills, topped many voters' lists of concerns, and voters who listed the economy as their primary concern picked Trump by a 4-to-1 margin. Joe Biden's insistence on staying in the race amid plummeting poll numbers likely also hindered Harris' ability to course-correct from an unpopular incumbent.

But to reach any sort of conclusion, Democrats will have to ignore their natural instincts to cast blame elsewhere, on disinformation or foreign interference or minor gaffes on the campaign trail. Whether they like it or not, Democrats received a drubbing on Tuesday, and only sincere soul-searching will yield any useful explanations.",center
1,https://reason.com/2024/11/05/the-inflation-election,The Inflation Election,"In retrospect, the most important incident along the road to this Election Day may not have been the Democratic Party's decision to shove aside President Joe Biden, or the unprecedented (and undemocratic) elevation of Vice President Kamala Harris to the top of the ticket. It wasn't the Republican Party's inability to break out of the thrall that Donald Trump holds over it, or the two assassination attempts aimed at him.

The thing that most shaped this election happened long before all that. It was a decision made in the early days of the Biden administration. With the last election barely in the rearview window, Biden pushed a major stimulus bill through Congress—a bill that spent $1.9 trillion, nearly all of it borrowed—despite warning signs that the already recovering economy might not be able to handle the full-throttle infusion of more dollars.

""Now is the time for big, bold action to change the course of the pandemic and begin economic recovery,"" Biden promised. Bloomberg termed it a ""big bet on run-it-hot economics,"" and noted that the White House had ""shrugged off warnings that the economy may overheat as a result.""

It was a wager that didn't pay off the way the White House had hoped.

A year later, inflation had surged to over 9 percent, its highest level in 40 years. As I've written before, that fact undersells the historical context: Before 2021, the last full year in which America experienced an average inflation rate of more than 4 percent was 1991. There was only a single year (2008) from then through 2020 when the annual inflation rate exceeded 3 percent. In other words, peak inflation in the first half of 2022 was two to three times worse than the worst bout of inflation that most Americans could easily recall.

For those of us who follow political and economic news for a living—or even as a serious hobby—all of this probably feels like, well, old news. Prices have been rising at a much more normal pace for the past year or more. In September, the annualized inflation rate was 2.4 percent. Higher than the prepandemic norm, but nothing that should cause an electoral freak-out.

But the average voter isn't a political or economics junkie, and much of America sees 2024 as the inflation election: a referendum on the federal policies that caused that brief and horrific surge in prices. (That causation is well established by now: A study by the St. Louis Federal Reserve found that ""domestic stimulus"" played a ""sizable role"" in driving inflation to 40-year highs.)

An Ipsos poll in August found that 50 percent of voters said inflation was their top concern heading into the election. In October, Gallup found that 90 percent of voters rated ""the economy"" as being ""extremely important"" or ""very important"" to their vote—the highest it has scored since the 2008 election in the depths of the mortgage crisis. Polling guru Nate Silver crunched the numbers further and found a stunning correlation: ""Each additional $100 of inflation in a state since January 2021 predicts a further 1.6 swing against Harris in our polling average vs. the Biden-Trump margin in 2020,"" he posted on X last week.

It's been impossible for the Biden-and-then-Harris ticket to escape the inflation issue for two reasons. First, Harris has been unwilling or unable to distance herself from the Biden administration. And, second, because the Biden White House made economic policy so central to its message for three years—even coming up with the counterproductive ""Bidenomics"" slogan.

""Bidenomics was, at heart, a philosophy of throwing money at programs, people, political allies, and favored constituencies. That spending contributed directly and significantly to the rapid rise in inflation that helped fuel voter dissatisfaction with the state of affairs,"" Reason's Peter Suderman summarized in a March 2024 cover story. ""Thanks to misallocation, poor implementation, and self-contradictory regulatory requirements, the substantive public payoffs to that spending have been weak at best and counterproductive at worst.""

Of course, there are logical counterpoints to the feelings voters have about inflation ahead of Election Day. For example, wages have gone up faster than prices. Moody's estimates that the average American household is now spending $1,120 more per month to buy the same goods and services as in January 2021, but is also earning $1,192 more per month. Some products have even defied inflation: Plane tickets are cheaper now than they were before the pandemic, as liberal commentator Matt Yglesias pointed out this week.

It's also true that former President Donald Trump's economic agenda seems likely to cause prices to rise. Mass deportations and huge new tariffs will cause all sorts of economic disruptions and will make Americans poorer. It seems bizarre that voters seeking a stable economy after the past four years would put their trust in an erratic populist, but if this election season has proven anything, it's that humans get pretty irrational about inflation. In part, that's because our brains attribute economic gains to our own accomplishments but look for someone (or something) else to blame when things go the other way. In other words, your paycheck got fatter because you worked harder, but your groceries got more expensive because Biden (or the big corporations) are out to get you.

Of course, that's not true—both things happened for the same reason—but inflation breaks our brains and Election Day is not a time for deep thinking about political science or psychology. Elections are decided by how people feel, and lots of Americans still feel pretty grumpy about how much it costs to go to the grocery store these days. It's really that simple.",center
2,https://reason.com/2024/11/04/dont-blame-me-for-not-voting-for-your-unbelievably-rotten-candidate,Don't Blame Me for Not Voting for Your Unbelievably Rotten Candidate,"With a day left before the 2024 polls close, I'd like to say something to the Republicans and the Democrats, the Trump chads and the Harris stans: Don't blame me for not voting for your shitty candidate.

There's a reason why presidential contests have been as tight as they have been for a while, and why control of Congress has flipped back and forth so much over the last couple of decades. It's not because of voters like me, who just want to vote for politicians and policies that won't bankrupt the country or rob me of the ability to make meaningful decisions in my life. It's not too much to ask for candidates who aren't colossal assholes, mental incompetents, or fakers that routinely lie and dissemble about all sorts of stuff. Your parties don't stand for anything consistent or appealing or responsible or responsive. You're not going to win elections easily until you stand for something consistent, productive, and respectful of the people you seek to govern.

Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are arguing about which one of them will add $4 trillion in new debt vs. which one will add $8 trillion, according to mid-range estimates from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Both want to abolish taxes on tips and have their own special twists on adjacent topics. Trump has said he also wants to end taxes on overtime and Social Security income and cap credit-card interest rates, while Harris wants to shovel ""free"" money at first-time homebuyers and push for free or nearly free college, plus a bunch of other stuff. Both have pledged to maintain old-age entitlements exactly as they are, meaning federal spending has nowhere to go but up as baby boomers retire en masse and are joined by Gen Xers, the oldest of whom are pushing 60. They each threaten free speech in their own ways and traffic in delusion (Trump, for instance, can't admit he lost the popular vote in 2016 and 2020, while Kamala won't say when she knew that President Joe Biden's brain was cooked).

We know what a Trump presidency will look like because he's served already. It wasn't great, considering that most of the new debt he added to the nation's came before COVID-19 tanked the economy. But it wasn't a disaster either, at least until COVID-19 came along and he pushed to shut the country down and put together the very team of awful public health bureaucrats he spends a lot of time railing against now, as if they just showed in the Oval Office one day.

As part of the Biden administration, Harris was co-pilot during an equally mediocre run in the White House, especially when it came to prolonging or intensifying many of the worst COVID-19 policies that started under Trump. But if we're being honest, despite all the best attempts of Biden/Harris to utterly tank the economy, it seems to be doing just fine, just like it was doing under Trump (which is to say, OK but not anywhere close to where it should be). The Dow Jones is doing swell, and for all their bitching and moaning, younger Americans are doing better than previous generations, with Millennials and older Gen Zers accruing more wealth than Gen X. And miracles of miracles: Gen Z is outpacing Millennials when it comes to home ownership. The genius of America is that we survive almost any fool presiding over us.

Whatever else you can say about Trump and Harris, this much is indisputable: They are not popular. Each is pulling under 50 percent of voters the day before the election. And their parties aren't exactly reeling them in, either. Per Gallup's survey during the last two weeks of October, just 29 percent of Americans identify as Republican and just 32 percent as Democrats—figures that are near all-time lows. Let the partisans explain why the rest of us are so misguided in our indifference or hostility to these candidates and their parties. Maybe one of these years, those partisans will get around to figuring out how to appeal to people outside of the shrinking groups who already agree with them.

Last week, I voted early and wrote in the Libertarian Party presidential candidate Chase Oliver on my New York ballot. Like a lot of places, the Empire State does everything it can to bump non-major-party choices from its ballots, resulting in much lower-than-average voter participation rates over the past seven presidential elections. But screw that, I was happy to have somebody to vote for who comes close to my vision of government. He's talking about reducing the size, scope, and spending of government only a few years before our biggest budget items are about to go tits up. Good on him.

I get why Democrats and Republicans try to limit choices for voters and then denounce those of us who refuse to go along. I'm not above partisanship and in fact, I would love to be able to vote for a candidate who might actually win the presidency. But the major party candidates by and large suck and, even in an era of overheated, mentally diminished rhetoric where supporters of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump both claim this could be the last election EVER, the difference between the two is less than meets the eye. Or same thing, it's not worth picking one over the other.

That's on them, not me or my fellow citizens who are holding out for something better.",center
3,https://reason.com/2024/11/05/bad-candidates-cant-fix-bad-politics,Bad Candidates Can't Fix Bad Politics,"We are officially in the last hours of the 2024 presidential election and the one thing we can say for sure is that most people are upset and miserable about their available options.

Supermajorities of voters consistently say that the country is on the wrong track. Neither major party candidate is viewed favorably by a majority of voters.

Consequently, the polls show an election that is neck-and-neck. The last-minute pitches from the candidates mostly boil down to why the other side deserves to lose. Reluctant vote-casters' last-minute explanations of who they're voting for likewise mostly describe what they're voting against.

""Never Trump"" conservative David French used his Sunday New York Times column to argue a Harris victory offers the chance to break the ""unique influence on Republican hearts and minds"" that Donald Trump possesses.

On the other side of the aisle, vaguely conservative comedian and political commenter Bridget Phetasy explained she's ""not voting for Donald J. Trump. I'm voting against the left"" and its ""anti-civilizational"" attitudes on crime, transgenderism, and cancel culture.

That's not a unique opinion. People who have never voted for Trump before say they're planning on casting a vote for him in 2024 as a protest against the party that ""closed playgrounds & schools, but open[ed] dog parks & liquor stores.""

Regardless of who one supports, everyone has a palpable sense that the best this election can offer is a chance to save the country from the worst cultural and political tendencies of the last decade.

In a Monday Substack essay, pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson summed up this collective attitude as the ""stop the madness"" election.

In focus groups she's conducted, Anderson says that few voters dwelled much on specific policies. Instead, they said that their vote was all about ""getting this country back to a place all citizens can be proud of,"" that the election presents ""a turning point on whether our democracy lives on or dies,"" and that they were most worried about ""my right to exist, live, and be free.""

""You may think you know which party someone is voting for from those answers. I assure you, you do not,"" writes Anderson. ""For all that we are so divided, I am struck by the way in which many Trump and Harris voters alike are talking about the election in these terms.""

All these voters are likely to be disappointed. The one thing we can say for sure about the results of the 2024 election is that the madness won't stop.

We know this because we've already lived through both outcomes that the election offers.

We know what a Trump victory means for defeating the ""anti-civilizational"" tendencies of the left. We know what a Trump defeat means for closing the book on toxic Trumpian populism.

In a perceptive weekend column, The New York Times' Ross Douthat details how liberals failed to deliver on their post-2016 promise that ""they would avoid insanity, they would maintain stability, and they would display far greater intelligence and competence than Trump and his hangers-on.""

Instead, he argues, they supplemented Trump's insanity with insanity of their own; embracing authoritarian COVID policies, pushing unproven treatments for gender dysphoria on children, and foreswearing the very concepts of law enforcement and border security.

The result is what liberals wanted to believe would be an ""obvious"" choice between Trump and the adults in the room is in fact a nail-biter contest in which the ""sane"" option is far from clear.

One needn't agree with Douthat's every diagnosis of liberalism's failures to see why many Trump-skeptical conservative and moderate voters still think he can be a bulwark against persistent left-wing unreason.

And yet, anyone thinking that by voting for Trump, they'll deflate the excesses of Trump-era liberalism is mistaken.

The left's alleged ""anti-civilizational"" attitudes weren't defeated during Trump's first term. Rather, they accelerated in opposition to him. Cancel culture, political correctness, ""wokeism,"" and ""follow the science"" fanaticism all hit their zenith under his administration.

Trump's control of the White House couldn't arrest what are broad cultural forces that often manifested themselves in state, local, and corporate policy outside the control of the executive branch. Trump's polarizing possession of the bully pulpit only encouraged the liberal excesses his voters (of both the die-hard or reluctant variety) hate so much.

The Biden administration has been a remarkably left-wing one. Yet, it's during the past four years that we've seen wokeism unwind as a political force and identity politics start to lose its grip on the discourse.

Trump's return to the White House will reverse this trend. His supernatural ability to incense his opponents will agitate the most fervent, most ridiculous elements of the Democratic ""resistance"" once again. Expect to get more cancel culture, not less, under a second Trump.

Meanwhile, a Harris victory can't hope to purge politics of Trumpian populism or even the man himself. We've already run that experiment too.

Biden won the White House in large part because of the electorate's exhaustion with Trump and the daily chaos he engendered.

Rather than accept this limited mandate to govern as a moderate, Biden turned his administration over to the most left-wing wonks in the room who subsequently regulated aggressively, spent with inflationary abandon, and pushed a hardline progressive agenda on social and environmental issues.

The electorate has largely hated the results. By the end of the night, it might well choose to punish Democrats by putting Trump back into office.

As a last-ditch effort to forestall that possibility, and to make up for the Biden-Harris administration's manifest unpopularity, Democrats have tried to make as much hay as they possibly can out of January 6. Witness Harris' decision to hold her last high-profile rally on the same spot where, several years prior, Trump urged his supporters to march to the capital in force.

This attack has fallen flat as well and predictably so.

That's because Democrats can only invoke January 6 as a cudgel, not an olive branch.

Their message to Trump-skeptical moderates, conservatives, libertarians, and whoever else isn't that they'll run a moderate and inclusive administration. The last four years prove that they won't. Rather Democrats' message is ""no matter how much you hate our policies, Trump is even worse, so you have to suck it up and vote for us.""

Perhaps the best distillation of this obnoxious pitch came from U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg a few weeks ago. ""Libertarians: if this is not a five-alarm fire for you then what is?"" he posted on X in response to a Washington Post article about former Trump advisers warning he would use the military against American citizens.

It apparently hasn't occurred to Buttigieg, or his boss, that libertarian-leaning voters would have been a little more receptive to that pitch if the last four years of their governance had been remotely libertarian.

Indeed, during the 2024 campaign neither Trump nor Harris have spent much time even pretending they'll shrink the size and scope of government. Libertarians can expect few policy wins over the next four years.

Voters of all stripes shouldn't expect our politics to get any better either.

There is much that's destructive and toxic in American public life right now. It's no surprise that everyone is unhappy, most people are voting for the lesser of two evils (if they feel motivated to vote at all), and we keep ping-ponging between unpopular, unsuccessful administrations.

Transcending this sad status quo will require talented, transformative candidates. None can be found on the ballot today.

Bad politics and bad ideas can't be fixed by bad candidates. But in this election, bad candidates are all we have to choose from.",center
4,https://reason.com/2024/10/01/double-hater-dead-enders,The Coming Vindication of the Double-Haters,"At the start of the summer, it looked like the 2024 presidential election might come down to the double-haters. Roughly 25 percent of voters told Pew pollsters they had unfavorable views of both Joe Biden and Donald Trump. (And this was before Trump's felony conviction and Biden's disastrous debate performance.)

Some of us are longtime double-haters in good standing. But it's worth putting those numbers in context. In 1988, only 5 percent of voters told pollsters they disapproved of both major party candidates. In 2000, that figure was 6 percent. Even the previous Trump-Biden matchup in 2020 pulled only 13 percent into the double-hater camp. For several months of this election cycle, Americans really were letting the hate flow through them in unprecedented ways.

But after Kamala Harris quickly and dramatically replaced Biden on the Democratic ticket, the double-haters seem to have disappeared into thin air. A bump for the Democrats was perhaps to be expected; Harris showed 48 percent favorability against 48 percent unfavorability in an August New York Times/Siena poll. But Trump also got a bump; his favorability number was the same as Harris', with 51 percent unfavorable.

Under different circumstances, one might assume the favorables increased as voters learned more about what the candidates would do as president. It's true that after an extended period with very little in the way of meaningful policy proposals, we're now entering a phase where both candidates are debuting bold new initiatives on a weekly or even daily basis. Unfortunately, these policy promises amount to little more than words that feel good in the candidates' mouths and the voters' ears.

In 2024 it's hard to shake the feeling that, from a policy perspective, the presidential contest offers less real substance than ever before. Rather than being a contest over policy, ideology, and principle, the race has descended into a spectacle of empty gestures, culture-war posturing, and a dizzying rush to outdo the opposition in meaningless rhetoric. It's the era of total policy nihilism.

In a race between Trump and Biden, policy nihilism was in some ways less consequential, because voters had the records of what both men had already done in their first terms as president, and actions speak louder than words. But Harris has a thin policy portfolio, little more than a series of missteps and abortive efforts in her role as vice president. As Elizabeth Nolan Brown explains in this month's cover story, Harris is currently trending away from some of her more extreme progressive policy stances. There's something heartening about the fact that mouthing platitudes about freedom remains a winning electoral strategy. Americans like freedom, and the GOP has mostly abandoned the field when it comes to liberty-promoting policy proposals and rhetoric.

There's no reason to believe Harris has had a change of heart, though. She's flopping toward freedom in order to win an election, and she's just as likely to flip back in office. In fact, Harris' policy stances are changing so rapidly it's difficult to say where she stands on much of anything, much less how that relates to the current administration's plans and goals.

Trump has long made policy on the fly, and in 2024 he can be more serenely confident than ever that the Republican intellectual and political apparatus will contort itself to conform with whatever he says. His recent notion to eliminate taxes on tips, for example—which seems to have come to him on the golf course or perhaps in the shower—went from being a casual remark to one of the central themes of the Republican National Convention in a matter of days. This, despite near-universal condemnation from economists and tax policy analysts of all ideological stripes.

The proposal tapped into a real yearning for a reduction of Americans' tax burden, especially for the working class. It felt good to say it, people liked to hear it—and implementing it would be a counterproductive nightmare. Naturally, it also became a Harris campaign pledge days later.

It's not just economic issues. Foreign policy also became an afterthought. Today, foreign policy functions downstream from domestic electoral politics and the culture war. The complexities of global power balances, human rights, and trade relations are flattened into caricatures and sound bites. Biden was already teetering on this line, changing his rhetoric in an attempt to meet the electoral moment, but his long record on Israel and other matters signaled strongly to voters what he would actually do. Not so with Harris.

Instead of being leaders who take seriously their obligation to govern, politicians are little more than symbols in a rhetorical war that's largely disconnected from day-to-day policy. They will literally say anything to get elected.

In election season, there's a certain dark freedom in policy nihilism. It allows candidates to campaign without accountability. If their policy proposals are flimsy and changeable, they reduce their own risk of being held to their promises. Knowing that the policy talk is meaningless allows voters to gloss over the difficult details of proposals, since the candidates are unlikely to pursue the policies they are discussing in a recognizable way once in office anyway. We're left with elections where the stakes feel apocalyptic, even as the substance hollows out.

But policy nihilism is only tenable for as long as the campaign lasts. Someone will win, and that person must govern—at which point the double-haters will almost certainly be proven right.",center
5,https://reason.com/2024/09/01/hanlons-razor-rusts,Hanlon's Razor Is Getting Rusty in the 2024 Election,"The summer's presidential politics have been ripe for conspiracism: the Democratic candidate switcheroo, the attempt on former President Donald Trump's life, the rise (and fall) of Project 2025, the late-breaking veepstakes. It's tempting to understand each of these plot developments as manifestations of an elite cabal's sinister game of 5D chess. We've never needed Hanlon's razor more.

Hanlon's razor reminds us not to attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. The namesake of the adage—a Robert Hanlon from President Joe Biden's beloved Scranton—offers little context for interpreting the phrase; it appeared as a stand-alone in a 1980 book of clever sayings. Later, it was picked up by early Usenet boards and often invoked to reject various conspiracy theories.

One of its most famous users is, confusingly, the similarly named Robert Heinlein. In his novella Logic of Empire, he offers this variant, to explain the recurrence of colonial slavery on Venus: ""You have attributed conditions to villainy that simply result from stupidity.""

While not quite as dire as Heinlein's Venusian dystopia, conditions here on Earth certainly look bleak. Far from being a grand master–level game of villainous chess, the final months of the 2024 U.S. election season are best understood as children playing a game of Sorry!

There was without a doubt a conspiracy of silence around Biden's cognitive decline. But Hanlon asks us to consider whether all but his very closest family and associates might have chosen not to examine the evidence too closely until the very end (""When Biden's 'Bubble Wrap' Burst""). His advisers almost certainly foolishly overestimated their capacity to manage his deficits and also guessed wrongly about the speed of his decline. There may indeed have been people involved who were motivated by ill intent, but they were never as powerful as the stupidity that dominated at every stage. The result was a chaotic scramble to replace Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris, the person who was already his most likely successor and replacement.

One might think presidential assassinations are an exception to Hanlon's razor. Surely taking potshots at politicians is pure malice in action? Not so fast. We remain largely in the dark about the motives and machinations behind the attempt on Trump's life, and the information we have about the shooter's politics seems mixed. Perhaps he, like John Hinckley Jr. before him (who took aim at Ronald Reagan in an attempt to win Jodie Foster's love), was laboring in ignorance (or delusion) about the way the world works. And, of course, he mostly missed.

Project 2025 is not unusual in Washington, D.C. Many think tanks—and magazines—conceive of themselves as the cartographers and human resources department of the nation's political future. They craft road maps and corral talent in order to be poised to strike when electoral victory is at hand. The goals of this particular cluster are more authoritarian than usual. But the methodology is familiar. What's notable isn't the belief that this strategy for influence could work; it has before. It's the belief that it could work now. As Stephanie Slade explains in this month's cover story (""'Only the Best People'""), the built-in dysfunction of the MAGA GOP is a form of insurance against a truly world-changing conspiracy. Trump himself has already quenched, fueled, and then reextinguished the fire of Project 2025 with casual remarks as he campaigns, and there are months left to go.

At least one reason we need Hanlon's razor in the first place is that many of the incompetents believe themselves conspiracists. It's more flattering, at least by certain lights, to be malicious than to be idiotic.

It used to be said that the Democrats were the stupid party and the Republicans were the evil party. In this, as in so many things, the two parties have moved closer together while also moving in the wrong direction, converging on policies and political practices that are both stupid and evil.

In recent political history, January 6 is the great test of how hard-core a Hanlonian one is willing to be. The riot and trespass on the Capitol was a display of villainy so stupid that it rusted the razor right through. Yet even there, stupidity proved to be the more powerful force. While there were certainly villains in the mob, the rowdy morons won the day—and lost the fight.

Hanlon's razor is, in the end, a call to condescending charity toward one's opponents and one we'd all do well to keep in mind as we descend into the final weeks of the election season.",center
6,https://reason.com/2024/10/17/how-are-reason-staffers-voting-in-2024/,How Are Reason Staffers Voting in 2024?,"This year, Reason celebrates 20 years of disclosing our votes. Since 2004, we have been asking—though not requiring—Reason staffers to explain who they're voting for and why in presidential election years. Believe me when I tell you we don't do this for our own health. We typically take a beating from every direction for the balance of our votes, or lack thereof. But we think it's important for the people who read, watch, and listen to Reason to know where our writers, editors, and producers are coming from. Who we vote for is a highly imperfect measure of our biases, but it's one we're happy to share in the spirit of transparency. This election—and every election—we urge other publications to follow our lead.

Traditionally, this survey yields a high percentage of Libertarian Party (L.P.) voters and nonvoters, and that remains true in 2024. This year we have 12 Chase Oliver voters (many of whom have horribly mean things to say about the L.P.), six nonvoters, three Kamala Harris voters (many of whom have horribly mean things to say about Harris), one Nikki Haley write-in, one Kennedy write-in (the Fox News host, not RFK Jr.), and two undecideds (one 50/50 Trump/Oliver and one 50/50 Trump/nobody). In general, the tone of the forum is bleak and discouraged, in keeping with the mood of the American public.

Reason is published by a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and therefore doesn't endorse particular candidates. But we also don't think one party or person ever fully embodies the things that are important to us, including individual liberty, free markets, and the rule of law. We know there is life outside of politics, and we look forward to returning to it once the election is over.

Now for some legalese: Nothing in what follows should be construed as an official endorsement of any candidate or cause. These are the personal views of individual participants and not the institutional views of Reason or Reason Foundation. But then, you knew that. —Katherine Mangu-Ward

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? If I were eligible to vote, I wouldn't choose any major-party candidate. Donald Trump's refusal to accept the 2020 election result is a huge red flag for me, as I fled Venezuela in part because the dictator, Nicolás Maduro, refused to acknowledge the election results and transfer power. But I also couldn't support Kamala Harris. Her stance on price controls mirrors the disastrous policies that led to food shortages and starvation in Venezuela. Plus, the harshest crackdown on asylum rights occurred when she was vice president. Despite granting Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans, deportation flights resumed, sending dissidents back to jail in Venezuela. I've never had the right to vote in free elections, but even here, I wouldn't cast a vote supporting the ""lesser evil.""

What past vote do you most regret? This was not a vote, but in 2016, I believed Donald Trump was the best option, mainly because of what I thought was his foreign policy approach: less nonsense intervention worldwide but maximum pressure against autocratic regimes. At the end of his presidency, he praised autocrats like Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin, and Nicolás Maduro.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? Arizona's Proposition 314 criminalizes undocumented immigrants, equating drug traffickers with refugees. It is likely to pass due to anti-immigrant sentiment. Still, this proposition redundantly bans crimes covered by federal law and risks promoting racial profiling against Latinos by state and local police.

Ronald Bailey

Science Correspondent

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? Back in 2008, I stated that ""the Republicans must be punished and punished hard."" They must be punished even harder in 2024! Given how the polls are running in Virginia, I will vote Libertarian: Chase Oliver/Mike ter Maat.

What past vote do you most regret? So many options! Certainly, George McGovern in 1972. Our country would have been in a much better place socially and economically had Mitt Romney won in 2012, so I feel some regret for my vote for Gary Johnson.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? Party primaries consistently throw up unhinged dimwits as candidates. So I am all in on ranked choice voting initiatives that are appearing in five states and D.C. Our city is also considering the adoption of ranked choice voting.

Billy Binion

Reporter

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? Whether or not I'll be eligible to vote is unclear, as I'm a new D.C. resident without an immediate path to establishing residency. (The last time I registered to vote I was living in Los Angeles, and there is a 0 percent chance I will be going through the hoopla to vote absentee.) But if the stars align, I'll vote for Chase Oliver. Despite having some policy differences with him, I cannot bring myself to vote for Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, neither of whom comes close to representing my values. D.C. also sways heavily Democratic, so the least I can do—the only thing I can do?—with my vote is to send a message that someone here would appreciate more choices.

What past vote do you most regret? Unless the unthinkable happened and my one singular vote swayed the course of history, I feel it unwise to spend emotional energy over past ballots I've cast. If I had to pick one, I suppose it would be the first election I voted in, which happened in my early college days when I was still sometimes regurgitating my parents' beliefs as my own. (I don't even remember who was on that ballot, so, again, I am spending approximately no emotional energy on this.)

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? I'll be interested to see how ranked choice voting fares in D.C. Viva ranked choice voting.

Eric Boehm

Reporter

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? If I vote, it will be for Chase Oliver. Donald Trump is utterly unfit for the office. Kamala Harris is unprepared and unprincipled. Oliver at least has the right values, and he represents the best of what the Libertarian Party could be.

What past vote do you most regret? No single vote is worth enough to be regretted.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? I'll be closely watching the ballot initiatives in several Western states (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada) that would do away with partisan primaries in some future elections in favor of top-four or top-five systems. That's an imperfect reform, but it would limit the power of the lunatic fringe in both parties and allow for more robust political competition.

Christian Britschgi

Reporter

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? No one. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris offer slightly different flavors of the same big-government, big-spending, protectionist, interventionist agenda that's anathema to the libertarian direction I'd like to see the country go. Additionally, Trump's call for deporting millions of people and Harris' limitless support for abortion demonstrate a fundamental, disqualifying lack of respect for individual dignity and freedom. Chase Oliver is running for president on the Libertarian Party ticket, much to the chagrin of the Libertarian Party. I wish him well but feel no particular obligation to vote for him. If there were a gun to my head, I'd cast a ballot for Harris given that Trump attempted to steal the last election. That's really something that can't (or at least shouldn't) be tolerated. But, since this is America, there is no gun to my head forcing me to vote, and therefore I won't.

What past vote do you most regret? I've voted twice in my life. Once for a random assortment of Boise City Council candidates in 2011 and once for Gary Johnson in 2012. Of those, I don't regret my vote for Gary.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? Proposition 33 in California would repeal state-level limitations on local rent control laws. Local governments are already drafting ruinous rent control policies to take effect if it passes—something recent polling suggests is within the realm of possibility.

In recent years, California has made halting progress toward liberalizing a restrictive land use regime that's responsible for making the Golden State the epicenter of America's housing cost and homelessness crises.

Giving local governments carte blanche to regulate rents would destroy that progress and then some. Rent control has been a disaster everywhere it's been tried. It reduces the supply and quality of rental housing and makes cities more expensive and hostile to newcomers.

California has the largest population and largest economy of any state in the country. Despite itself, it continues to produce and sustain innovative, dynamic industries that are building our bright, techno-optimist future.

Regardless of where in the country you live, you should want to see a California that's growing, prosperous, and relatively free. A victory for Proposition 33 would be a huge step back for the state, and therefore, the country.

Elizabeth Nolan Brown

Senior Editor

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? Chase Oliver. The Libertarian Party may be a hot mess, but it's still the hot mess closest to my heart. And I was happy to see Oliver get the party's nomination. It's a lovely rebuke to the folks who think libertarians are or should be largely culturally conservative.

What past vote do you most regret? I've only voted in two past presidential elections—in 2008 (for Barack Obama) and in 2020 (for Jo Jorgensen)—and I don't really regret either. There are plenty of things to criticize about the Obama presidency, but I still think it was preferable to a John McCain presidency. Also, to quote Eric Boehm from last election cycle: ""I can't imagine thinking a single vote is valuable enough to spend time regretting.""

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? I'll be closely watching the abortion initiatives on state ballots. Since the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, state ballot initiatives concerning abortion have been big—and, so far, the pro-choice position has come out on top in every state where they have been tried, including in places like Kansas and Ohio. It will be interesting to see if this persists this year, especially in states like Florida, Missouri, and South Dakota.

Emma Camp

Assistant Editor

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? Chase Oliver. I had originally planned not to vote for anyone. But I was pleasantly surprised when Oliver won the Libertarian Party nomination despite the state of the current L.P. leadership, which seems attached less to advancing liberty than to owning the libs.

I live in profoundly blue D.C., which frees me from any feeble notion that my vote could impact the presidential election, and therefore from any feeling of obligation to vote for anyone other than the candidate who best aligns with my values. Of the options, Oliver comes closest to meeting my small-l libertarian priorities.

If I lived in a swing state, I would cast an extremely unenthusiastic vote for Kamala Harris. While I have successfully resisted becoming coconut-pilled, I do sincerely hope Harris wins because Donald Trump is an aspiring authoritarian maniac.

What past vote do you most regret? I thankfully haven't cast enough ballots in tight enough races to think any of my votes are worth regretting.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? I'll be closely watching the ranked choice voting ballot measures in Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon, and voting in favor of it in D.C. Surprise, surprise, a third-party voter likes ranked choice voting.

C.J. Ciaramella

Criminal Justice Reporter

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? In 2020 I broke my 16-year streak of not voting in presidential elections because I thought Donald Trump was actually unfit for office by whatever standard you wanted to use: mentally, emotionally, ethically. It turns out I was 100 percent correct, because then he tried to steal the election and ginned up a mob of his fans to storm the Capitol building.

I would prefer to return to not voting, but Republicans insisted on rewarding Trump for his behavior by nominating him again. I will once more vote for the candidate with the best chance of beating him, Kamala Harris, because Trump doesn't deserve to hold office and I find him personally detestable.

What past vote do you most regret? Because of my long streak of not voting, I'm unburdened by what has been.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? The most important elections are for your local sheriff and prosecutor offices, whose policies are far more likely to directly impact your community than whoever is sitting in the Oval Office.

Bekah Congdon

Deputy Managing Editor

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election?

Despite the best efforts of the Libertarian Party's loathsome leadership—embracing bigotry, antisemitism, and very-onlineism—the delegates managed to nominate a smart, well-rounded, empathetic candidate in Chase Oliver. He has earned my vote. There was a remote chance I might have voted Democrat for the first time this year, but Kamala Harris has made no meaningful shift in her rhetoric or plans regarding Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza. She has failed to earn my vote.

What past vote do you most regret? I've learned not to hold shame for decisions I made when I was young and indoctrinated. That said, my first eligible vote was in 2008, and I knew as soon as I left the polling place that I regretted voting for John McCain. (By 2012, I was writing in Ron Paul.)

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? Unfortunately, no one but the president can meaningfully affect foreign policy, but we need more people at every level of government who oppose American-funded genocide and endless war, and who do not believe that civilians in one country are more worthy of life than civilians in another country.

Natalie Dowzicky

Managing Editor, video and podcast

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? Even though Pennsylvania has offered me as many mail-in ballots as my heart desires, this is my first presidential election as a registered voter in Virginia. I guess it's exciting that my vote matters even less than it did before? With that in mind, I'm choosing to vote for the least worst option: Kamala Harris. We agree on very little, but I'm fairly certain that America can't withstand another four years of Donald Trump. (And there's no telling what he would do in 2028.) I hope you know that this vote brings me absolutely no joy.

What past vote do you most regret? I don't regret any of my previous votes. I try to live with ""no ragrets"" as the cool kids say these days.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? The 10 ballot measures in various states having to do with abortion are what I'm keeping my eyes on. Voters in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New York, Nevada, and South Dakota will decide whether or not their respective states should enshrine a right to abortion in their constitutions. Personally, I don't want the state making any decisions about my body, but we'll see what happens.

Nick Gillespie

Editor at Large

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? I will write in a vote for Chase Oliver, the Libertarian Party nominee (he is not on the official ballot in New York, where I live). He is not simply the best candidate running in 2024—and the only one talking at all about reducing the size, spending, and scope of the federal government—but he is one of the most consistent and thoughtful people the L.P. has ever run. He always explains and defends his positions from the starting point that individuals should have more control over the most important decisions in their lives. Critics who accuse him of being pro–COVID lockdown, pro–vaccine mandate, or pro–gender reassignment surgery for minors are either wholly ignorant of or willfully misreading his clearly stated positions on these issues. He has laid out rationales for sunsetting old-age entitlements, reining in the military-industrial complex, and maximizing expression and lifestyle freedom that are philosophically sound, pragmatic, and persuasive. It's a damn shame that he is not receiving full support from not only his own party but from many people who insist that, no really, they are libertarian. Except when it comes to voting for someone in favor of free trade, increasing legal immigration, halving defense spending, defending the Second Amendment, and legalizing drugs.

What past vote do you most regret? Walter Mondale in 1984. It was the first presidential election in which I could vote and I was drawn to his explicit promise to reduce the deficit and, I guess, his legendary ""Norwegian charisma"" that led him to lose 49 states out of 50. I don't regret that he lost so badly (and deservedly, really). But there was a perfectly good L.P. candidate, David Bergland, I could have thrown away my vote on.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? In Arizona, voters will get to choose between Proposition 140 (the Single Primary for All Candidates and Possible RCV General Election Initiative) and Proposition 133 (the Require Partisan Primaries and Prohibit Primaries Where Candidates Compete Regardless of Party Affiliation Amendment). The former would prohibit partisan primaries and mandate that the top finishers move on to the general election. The latter would require partisan primaries and prohibit open ballots where the top few move on to the general election. I strongly support the latter; parties play a powerful function by vetting candidates, refining their platforms, and providing clear alternatives to voters. As can be seen from California's experience with a system in which the top two vote-getters in a so-called jungle primary move on to the general election, such a system effectively freezes out third parties and merely consolidates or deepens the status quo. The L.P., the party that comes closest to consistently reflecting my political positions, is in dreary shape at the national level and in most states, but it and other minor parties have no real role to play in a single-primary system in which only the top two or three candidates move on to a general election.

Fiona Harrigan

Associate Editor

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? No one. I'm not interested in regretting my vote, and the best way to ensure that is not to vote.

What past vote do you most regret? I've only voted in one election cycle. I don't especially regret the choices I made then, but I regret thinking they were so important.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? Arizona Proposition 314—which, among other things, would make it a state crime for noncitizens to enter Arizona outside an official port of entry and allow state and local law enforcement to arrest people for unlawful border crossings. Beyond casting a punitive eye on undocumented communities and individuals, the measure would raise taxpayer costs and broaden police powers, shielding law enforcement from civil lawsuits should they violate someone's rights. Those are concerning things—and if the measure passes, Arizona will join a growing list of states that accept those things for questionable payoff.

Joe Lancaster

Assistant Editor

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election?

Neither major party's candidate gets me particularly excited, and I expect each would pursue policies that I will oppose. But since I find myself once again in a swing state, I feel compelled to choose one or the other. Wrongheaded and potentially unconstitutional policymaking can be prevented by Congress and the judiciary; on the other hand, the mechanism for dealing with a candidate who spreads racist lies about immigrants and minority groups is the ballot box. As such, I will vote for Kamala Harris.

What past vote do you most regret? In my first election, a couple of local incumbents ran unopposed for reelection—people I had met in person and found too slick and politician-y for my taste. Perhaps foreshadowing my future career path, I regret that I voted for them anyway and didn't either leave those spots blank or just write in ""Batman"" and ""Robin.""

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? Voters in four states and Washington, D.C., will decide whether to adopt ranked choice voting for future elections. Instead of the traditional system, in which the winner is whoever has the most votes (in some cases, even without a majority), ranked choice would allow voters to rank the entire list of candidates in order of preference. With so much partisan rancor and little chance of third parties finding a foothold in a winner-take-all system, ranked choice could potentially shake up our stodgy political institutions and offer palatable alternatives.

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? I never vote, for all the reasons outlined in this classic Reason cover story.

What past vote do you most regret? I remain foggy on whether I voted in 1998, the first year I was eligible. I definitely registered, because I still have a tattered paper card indicating my polling place. If I voted, I regret it.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? It looks like 16 cities in Oregon are considering bans on psilocybin mushrooms, which were legalized statewide in 2020 by Measure 109. I'd hate to see legal psychedelics lose ground, especially as part of a drug recriminalization backlash largely unrelated to innocent fungi.

Robert W. Poole Jr.

Former Reason Editor in Chief; Director of Transportation Policy, Reason Foundation

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? Because Florida is not a swing state this year, I am spared the horrible choice between two unsuitable candidates—both protectionists, both with loony tax ideas, and both ignoring out-of-control peacetime federal spending and the looming national debt disaster. In a number of previous presidential elections, I've voted for the Libertarian candidate. Not this time: I cannot vote for a defense-policy isolationist who mimics Neville Chamberlain's response to Hitler's invasion of other countries. I will write in a qualified candidate, Nikki Haley.

What past vote do you most regret? I most regret having voted to reelect Trump in 2020 as the lesser evil. The invasion of the Capitol building showed me how wrong that vote was.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? The most important ballot measures this year concern abortion. Because the GOP in recent years has gone overboard in support of abortion bans, the opportunity for pro-choice voters to overturn extreme bans may shift some candidate races in favor of left-wing Democrats.

Jason Russell

Managing Editor, Reason magazine

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? Chase Oliver. The odds of my lone vote being the decisive vote in my state, and Virginia being the decisive state in the presidential election, are infinitesimally small. Even if I lived in Pennsylvania or some other swing state, I'd feel the same way about my single vote. Regardless of my preference between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, I have no qualms whatsoever about voting for the candidate whom I am closest to ideologically.

What past vote do you most regret? In 2012, I left the presidential portion of my ballot blank. I was a college student in New York but registered to vote in my home state of Michigan. I would have voted for Gary Johnson, but Michigan was one of two states to not list him on the ballot (though I now see Michigan would have accepted a write-in vote for him). Even though I felt more ideologically aligned with Mitt Romney and was strongly rooting for him over President Barack Obama, I decided I was too worried about Romney possibly invading Iran. Come 2016, with Trump getting the Republican nomination, I regretted holding Romney to such a high standard and wished I had cast my first presidential vote for my home state's native son.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? I'm keeping an eye on Amendment 2 in Kentucky, which would allow the state Legislature to distribute education tax dollars outside the traditional K-12 system. The state constitution's version of the Blaine Amendment is so strict that a 2022 law funding public charter schools was deemed unconstitutional—so Kentucky remains one of the few states without charter schools, which are increasingly shown to be a great option for students. Amendment 2 would allow the Legislature to fund students ""outside the system of common schools,"" so education savings accounts and other kinds of educational freedom would be on the table as well.

Robby Soave

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election?

The best thing one can say about Kamala Harris is that she has renounced several of the bad policy ideas of…Kamala Harris, circa 2019. Even so, that's not much of an endorsement. Moreover, her selection of Tim Walz—a big government liberal and COVID-19 tyrant—is disqualifying for the entire ticket.

Donald Trump is an improvement over Joe Biden on some issues—Trump doesn't want to ban TikTok, at least for the moment—but many of the current administration's worst economic ideas (i.e., tariffs) would be continued or even expanded under Trump. It's also hard to take seriously the idea that Trump will somehow succeed in reducing the vast federal bureaucracy during his second term after he manifestly failed to do so during his first. Never forget that Trump gave Anthony Fauci a presidential commendation. Thus, the choice is clear: I will be voting for Chase Oliver.

What past vote do you most regret? I regret nothing. I voted for Jo Jorgensen and Gary Johnson in previous election cycles and would do so again.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? While I expect the presidential election to be extremely close, my hunch is that Harris will ultimately win. Given that outcome, it becomes vital that Republicans either retain control of the House of Representatives or recapture the Senate. The House map is dicey, but there are several hotly contested Senate races—in Montana, West Virginia, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan—where Republicans could prevail. I hope they do. Divided government is liberty's best friend.

What past vote do you most regret? I've only voted once, for George W. Bush in 2004. Look how that turned out!

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? Florida's Amendment 3, which has flaws, but would legalize recreational pot in the Sunshine State.

Jacob Sullum

Senior Editor

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? Chase Oliver. Despite his inability to distinguish between ""genocide"" and a defensive war with disturbingly high civilian casualties (also a terrible thing that kills innocent people, but qualitatively different in terms of motive and intent), he represents a refreshing contrast to the muddled thinking and authoritarian tendencies of all the other candidates.

What past vote do you most regret? In grade school, I voted for myself in the nail-bitingly close election of a class president. I had previously agreed with my friend Larry that I would vote for him and he would vote for me, because we somehow had the impression that voting for yourself was unseemly. After our teacher told all of us that such squeamishness was inappropriate, I signaled to Larry that we should abandon our arrangement and vote for ourselves. But he did not understand my gesture and voted for me as originally planned. I was elected by one vote, our teacher said that was fine despite the misunderstanding, and I still feel bad about it.

Apart from the presidency, what do you think is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? I'm not sure it gets top billing, but it will be interesting to see what happens with the marijuana legalization initiative in Florida, which Donald Trump has endorsed and Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) vigorously opposes. As a constitutional amendment, the measure needs support from at least 60 percent of voters to pass, and polls suggest the outcome will be close. If voters in a previously purple but increasingly red state like Florida favor toleration of recreational use by the requisite margin, it will be a sign that the conservative backlash against legalization is fizzling, reinforcing the significance of a presidential race featuring two major-party candidates who have both turned against pot prohibition.

J.D. Tuccille

Contributing Editor

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? In 2020, Donald Trump was a thuggish agent of chaos and Joe Biden promised—bullshit though it was—to be a moderate uniter. Trump is still a thin-skinned narcissist heading a cult of personality. But Democrats met Republican authoritarianism with ""hold my beer"" totalitarian intolerance for dissent. I'm torn between a principled vote for Chase Oliver, who is a better candidate than the moldering corpse of the L.P. deserves, or joining my wife who fears the left's antisemitism in voting for Trump. Oliver is a capable advocate for liberty representing a collapsing organization, while Trump, scumbag though he is, could be less bad than the empty vessel for the control freaks around her that is Kamala Harris.

What past vote do you most regret? I regret no vote so much as I already regret this year's vote.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? Arizona has a true libertarian, Clint Bolick, on its state Supreme Court. Bolick is up for a retention election this year, which will decide whether he holds his seat. I'm enthusiastically voting for him.

Jesse Walker

Books Editor

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? Chase Oliver.

What past vote do you most regret? I have a double regret from the year I became eligible to vote. I started 1988 as a leftist, albeit with increasingly strong libertarian inclinations; I ended it as a libertarian, though with some vestigial left-wing sympathies. If I had voted for the guy I was rooting for in the primaries and for the candidate I liked best in November—Jesse Jackson and Ron Paul, respectively—that would have summed up the journey pretty well. Instead I skipped the primaries and then cast a lesser-evil vote for…Dukakis? Well, at least it wasn't Bush.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? They say the most important races are the ones in your backyard, and those are certainly the only ones where your ballot might make a difference. So for me I guess it's one of these: I'm voting to impose term limits on the planning board, to give the county an independent inspector general, to expand the size of the county council so as to shrink the size of the members' districts, and, as usual, to reject all the bond questions and to eject all the sitting judges.

Zach Weissmueller

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election?

For the first time since I was eligible, I will not be voting in the presidential election. They finally broke me. The isidewith.com quiz tells me that I am aligned on policy five times more closely with Trump than with Harris. I desperately want him to follow through on freeing Ross Ulbricht. And yet, I can't vote for somebody who leveraged unproven voter fraud claims to attempt a self-coup, suggested the ""termination"" of aspects of the Constitution, and picked a vice president who's suggested ignoring court rulings. Rule of law is a nonnegotiable principle. Harris announcing as one of her first policies price controls to tackle inflation is a deal-killer. I cannot vote this kind of economic illiteracy into the White House, nor support the Democrats' agenda to pack—er, ""reform""—the Supreme Court. I like Chase Oliver and especially appreciate his commitment to ending foreign aid and slashing the debt, two areas where Ds and Rs are severely lacking. But the Libertarian Party doesn't even want me to vote for him. My nonvote conveys a rejection of the broken process and party machinery that led to a third Trump nomination, a last-minute Harris switcheroo, and increasingly marginal Libertarian Party presidential candidates.

What past vote do you most regret? In 2020, I wrote that ""I just hope I don't regret my first lesser-of-two-evils vote this year"" after voting Biden. Surprise: I do regret it. In light of Biden's unconstitutional OSHA workplace vaccine mandate and the inflationary spending, I wish I had abstained.

Apart from the presidency, what do you think is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? There are six statewide ranked choice voting ballot initiatives—four to enact, one to repeal, and one to prohibit—as well as one in D.C. and numerous similar local ballot initiatives. If ranked choice voting could pick up momentum this election cycle, it could initiate a serious and much-needed structural change in U.S. elections. Multicandidate elections with runoffs tend toward more moderate and centrist candidates, but in some cases can also open up possibilities for libertarians, as recently happened in Argentina. This kind of fundamental change in how we vote may be the only way, long term, that our increasingly unhinged national politics might course-correct.

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election?

Almost certainly Kennedy. Not Robert F., but our beloved Fox broadcaster pal and Reason contributor, Lisa Kennedy Montgomery. Very nice lady. There are only two names on my ballot, because the state of New York is so brutally effective at suppressing political competition, so I will have to write in somebody. Though there is a wee small chance I may yet throw a futile bone at Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver, who I certainly like more than the rest of his 2024 competitors (and some L.P. nominees of elections past). Party leaders at both the state and national levels have been working actively to alienate voters like me, so it feels almost unsporting to not give them the W. New York hasn't cracked 41 percent for a Republican since ""Kokomo"" hit No. 1, so my vote will not affect the desultory major-party race. I genuinely, if not quite equally, disdain not just Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, but their dishonest running mates as well. Great country; lousy politics.

What past vote do you most regret? I explained my Michael Dukakis regret last time around, so let's add a second: In 2008, having just moved to the District of Columbia, I neglected to get my voter registration sorted in time, thus depriving Dave Chappelle or Bob Barr or whoever of my crucial write-in vote. More importantly, it robbed me of one of my greatest civic pleasures: sending Katherine Mangu-Ward a selfie of me with an ""I voted"" sticker.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? Question 3 in Massachusetts is the latest blue-state attempt to saddle the innovative 21st century gig economy with hoary 20th century labor models, in this case allowing ride-share drivers to unionize, instead of retaining their current status as independent contractors. As Reason Foundation's Marc Scribner and Baruch Feigenbaum conclude, ""Due to driver voting eligibility requirements, the part-time nature of the work for the vast majority of gig workers, and high driver turnover, one practical implication is that a minority of drivers may be able to force the majority of drivers into work arrangements they may not favor."" Not great, Bob!

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election?

I am currently a legitimately undecided voter. I may do the dirtiest deed and vote for Donald Trump. It brings me no pleasure to report this, and I imagine the screenshots of this answer will be circulated by the online ne'er-do-wells to (rightly?) shame me for years to come. Stolen election claims and a refusal to put the kibosh on the democracy-subverting activities of January 6 disturb me, as do tariffs, but I am more optimistic about the economic conditions that will arise as a result of a Trump administration and I was pleased with his Supreme Court picks during his first term. Price controls, court packing, and massive amounts of government spending, which I expect to accompany a Harris presidency, will simply not work for me. I do not think the Libertarian candidate has done a very good job of putting himself out there, nor do I believe the Libertarian Party is a viable force in American politics. I am angry that my choices are between a descent into populism ushered in by the right or a descent into populism ushered in by the left. If I do not vote for Trump, I will simply not vote and instead do a cold plunge in the ocean, which will cleanse me of my disgust and calm my weary soul.

What past vote do you most regret? If I pull the lever for my compatriot from Queens, this will probably be the vote I regret the most. Conveniently, I live in New York, so it doesn't matter. I will sleep soundly regardless, lulled to dreamland by an ever-increasing sense of nihilism.

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota are all voting on measures that would expand or protect abortion access. Quite a few of these measures don't just protect abortion early in a pregnancy, but until viability (around 24 weeks) or even later in cases where a doctor deems the health of the mother to be at risk. Other measures—such as Colorado's—would force private insurers to cover the procedure. It's likely that voters will move in the direction of expanding and protecting abortion access—as they frequently have when offered the choice after Dobbs—but for consistent life ethic types like myself, that's not cause for celebration.

Who will get your vote in the 2024 presidential election? I plan to write in Chase Oliver. His platform is the closest to representing my views. And I'm registered in D.C. so it doesn't matter anyway.

What past vote do you most regret? I don't think I've ever voted in the majority, so no regrets here!

Apart from the presidency, what is the most important race or ballot initiative being decided this fall? I'll be watching Question 5 in Massachusetts, which asks voters to phase out the ""tip credit"" for restaurant servers. I'm currently finishing a documentary for Reason on the effects of tip credit elimination here in Washington, D.C., which has so far led to reduced restaurant employment and increased food prices.",center

""The other part, though, is the chaos…..And there is the potential, if we're not all collectively on guard, that chaos can ensue at varying levels.""

Wray, who was speaking at January's International Conference on Cyber Security, was referring to the risk of foreign interference in U.S. elections by China, Russia, and Iran. But America is a proud, independent nation. We're doing just fine sowing homegrown chaos at varying levels on our own.

Wray can take solace in the fact that most Americans actually do have confidence in our election system. About two-thirds tell Gallup they are very or somewhat confident that votes will be accurately cast and counted in U.S. elections; that number has been mostly stable since at least 2004. There is a gap opening up under the surface, however. In 2017, 77 percent of Republicans were confident about American elections. The most recent figure is 40 percent.

At the same time, a poll from the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that majorities of both Democrats (72 percent) and Republicans (55 percent) say democracy is at risk depending on the results of the next election, though presumably for different reasons. Relatedly, in a CBS News/YouGov poll released in January, 49 percent of Americans say they expect a violent response to future presidential election losses.

***

All of this adds up to a worrying situation, especially given dozens of newly constructed off-ramps on the road to a peaceful transition of power. Americans—including our politicians—are hyperalert for misconduct on the part of those who disagree with them politically, thanks to dramatically increased affective polarization. The proliferation of state-level voting laws and regulations could generate a cascade of legal and partisan challenges regarding voter eligibility, ballot access, and counting procedures. Newly appointed state election officials might introduce errors into the counts, either through guile or incompetence. Mail-in ballots might be counted too early. Mail-in ballots might be counted too late. A real cyberattack might raise concerns about the integrity of electronic voting machines. A fake cyberattack might do the same. Partisans might engage in voter intimidation. Partisans might allege voter intimidation where none occurred. Election workers might commit fraud. Election workers might not commit fraud but be accused of doing so anyway by prominent figures in a defamatory way. A sitting president might attempt to bully state election officials into finding ""lost"" votes. Never mind the Electoral College, which has been bonkers from the start. And that's all before we get to the legal challenges that both parties have promised to file after the fact.

***

It was hard to pick just one potential breaking point from this wealth of options, but in this month's cover story, Princeton University's Keith E. Whittington explores one of the ways 2024 might go off the rails in an underexplored and unprecedented way (page 20). The four criminal cases pending against Donald Trump might come to fruition in at least seven different scenarios that would leave the country grappling with a president who could or should be behind bars. Pair that with the possibility that one or both of the elderly men seeking the presidency could experience some kind of subfatal medical event as a candidate or president-elect, and it's time to call in the experts.

According to a January release from Gallup, ""less than a third of Americans say they would be willing to vote for someone nominated by their party who is over the age of 80 or has been charged with a felony or convicted of a felony by a jury."" Thus, in a Trump-Biden contest, ""voters would face a choice between two of the most objectionable characteristics to Americans of those measured—someone who has been charged with a felony (Trump) and someone who is older than 80 (Biden)."" In the end, about one-third of eligible Americans—including me—will likely not vote for either major-party candidate.

Perhaps the greatest destabilizing influence is simply the widely held belief that the election will be destabilizing. A January poll conducted by Echelon Insights found that only 27 percent of Americans think Biden will usher in more stability, while 49 percent say things would be less stable. The responses for Trump are more evenly split: 45 percent more stable, 43 percent less stable.

By doubling down on undesirable candidates backed by partisans who are increasingly skeptical of the prospect of a fair and peaceful election process, we've dramatically increased the risk of disarray without the possibility of any outcome that voters genuinely want.

In 2016, disruption—and, yes, maybe even a little chaos—sounded fun and appealing to many Americans, perhaps even for its own sake. But after two cycles of turmoil and very little real change, voters are seeking stability from an election that offers nothing of the kind.",center
8,https://reason.com/2024/04/04/no-labels-is-no-mas-for-the-2024-election/,No Labels Is No Más for the 2024 Election,"After years of heavy-breathing hints about giving polarization-fatigued Americans a bipartisan presidential choice, and months of painstakingly obtaining ballot access in nearly two dozen states, the 14-year-old centrist nonprofit No Labels has decided to not act like a political party after all.

""Americans remain more open to an independent presidential run and hungrier for unifying national leadership than ever before,"" founding CEO Nancy Jacobson said in a press release Thursday afternoon. ""But No Labels has always said we would only offer our ballot line to a ticket if we could identify candidates with a credible path to winning the White House. No such candidates emerged, so the responsible course of action is for us to stand down.""

According to The Wall Street Journal, which broke the news, Jacobson had recently told supporters that the group went 0 for 30 in reaching out to potential ""unity ticket"" candidates. Among the refuseniks: Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I–Ariz.), runner-up 2024 GOP contender Nikki Haley, vanquished Democratic challenger Dean Phillips (D–Minn.), former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, and Sen. Joe Manchin (D–W.Va.).

Besides confronting the cruel math of third party/independent presidential politics, the organization is still reeling from the sudden death on March 27 of founding chairman Joe Lieberman, the longtime former senator (both Democratic and independent), who made history as Al Gore's running mate in the razor-thin 2000 election.

This latest failure of establishment/moneyed centrism in presidential politics follows the derailed ambitions of Haley, Bill Weld, Michael Bloomberg, Howard Schultz, Evan McMullin, and plenty of others. Those with longer memories may recall the 2012 flash-in-the-pan Americans Elect, an internet-based third party that obtained ballot access in 29 states before abruptly closing shop.

Jacobson in her statement tried to put a brave face on things, but it's hard to imagine the organization doing much more than pushing its bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus on Capitol Hill.

""We will…remain engaged over the next year during what is likely to be the most divisive presidential election of our lives. We will promote dialogue around major policy challenges and call out both sides when they speak and act in bad faith,"" she vowed. ""Like many Americans, we are concerned that the division and strife gripping the country will reach a critical point after this election, regardless of who wins. Post-election, No Labels will be prepared to champion and defend the values and interests of America's commonsense majority.""

The group's mushy, hawkish, 30-point Common Sense Policy agenda will now have to be championed mostly outside the presidential race. Why? Because the people gaining traction on the political margins are not D.C. lifers repackaging ancient Reaganism. They are outsiders, even the one with the famous name.

In five-way national polling, independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is averaging 10.5 percent—numbers not seen since the days of Ross Perot—and fellow independent Cornel West is at 2 percent, with presumptive Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 1.7 percent. Most polls as of yet do not include anyone from the Libertarian Party (L.P.), whose nominating convention is in late May, with no clear front-runner. The L.P. is coming off three consecutive third-place presidential finishes.

Kennedy, Stein, and the Libertarian nominee are all good bets to qualify for a majority of state ballots, with the L.P. currently in the lead, though Kennedy has plenty of money to throw at the problem. Notably, and very unlike No Labels, those three candidates plus West are all considerably more dovish on foreign policy than either President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump.

With American public opinion souring on Israel's war against Hamas, the anti-interventionist vote, which is constantly underrated by the more hawkish journalistic class, has plenty of alternative candidates to choose from. No Labels may be over, but third party sentiment in 2024 is alive and well.",center
9,https://reason.com/2024/12/30/politics-without-journalism/,The 2024 Campaign Was an Embarrassment for Elite Media,"On September 25, more than two months after entering the presidential race, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris finally sat down for her first one-on-one interview with a national television reporter.

It wasn't just any reporter. Stephanie Ruhle, host of a nightly show on the Democrat-cheerleading cable network MSNBC, had, just five days prior, ridiculed the very notion that journalists, let alone voters, needed to hear anything more from the vice president before Election Day. ""Let's say you don't like her answer. Are you going to vote for Donald Trump?"" an exasperated Ruhle demanded to know from co-panelist Bret Stephens on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher, after the New York Times columnist suggested undecided voters—presciently, it would turn out after Trump's victory—could use more information from Harris. ""We have two choices….There are some things you might not know her answer to, [but] in 2024, unlike 2016, for a lot of the American people, we know exactly what Trump will do, who he is, and the kind of threat he is to democracy.""

When Stephens protested that ""I don't think it's too much to ask for her to sit down for a real interview,"" Ruhle shot back: ""I would just say to that, when you move to nirvana, give me your real estate broker's number, and I'll be your next-door neighbor. We don't live there.""

Ruhle, a former managing director at Deutsche Bank, will not likely be moving any time soon from her town house on Manhattan's Upper West Side or summer cottage on Long Beach Island. But the anchor's zinger, praised by the likes of The Atlantic's Tom Nichols and The Nation's Joan Walsh, did signal another kind of shift. Thirty-six years after CNN's Bernard Shaw gutted Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis with a single debate question (""Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?""), journalists increasingly view their vocation's role in the political arena as instrumental rather than adversarial: How does their work affect the electoral bottom line?

Ruhle's eventual sit-down with Harris illustrated the artistic limits of this functionalist approach. ""To call the interview with MSNBC softball,"" snarked The New York Sun's Dean Karayanis afterward, ""would be an injustice to the game."" The 25-minute exchange better resembled T-ball, with such participation trophy set-ups as ""Can we trust you?"" and ""[Trump] said he will be the protector of women if elected. Can you respond to that?"" Left unmentioned was a question that, remarkably, did not get asked of Harris until Fox News anchor Bret Baier brought it up on the 87th day of her candidacy: When, exactly, did she notice her boss was experiencing age-related decline, and what did she do about it?

""As reporters,"" Bernard Shaw once reminisced, ""we were not doing our jobs if we don't ask the toughest question possible."" Well, that was then. But what is now?

A surface analysis of the modern media ecosystem might conclude the industry has transitioned into a more conscious partisanship, embracing rather than downplaying a political bias that has metastasized from majoritarian to dominant. Defenders of this mission creep call it ""moral clarity""; detractors deride it as orthodoxical and ""woke.""

But that reductionist picture zooms in on the tusks while missing the rest of the elephant. The basic condition of the industrialized journalistic project is massive and long-term institutional decline—of audience, of reach, of employment, of influence. In a way that mainstream reporters and their antagonists struggle to accept, the media, comparatively, don't really matter anymore. There's not enough there there to sustain the role of either hero or villain. No one cares about editorial endorsements; candidates prefer talking to comedians and podcasters; October-surprise investigative heaves rarely move the needle.

Yet the business of politics, and discussion thereof, continues to grind on. That activity now takes place in an informational context unrecognizable from even a generation ago, with politicos adapting to new sets of power dynamics and market incentives that are far less anchored in the aspirational pursuit of truth. As the catastrophe of Hurricane Helene amply demonstrated, these contemporary conditions can materially degrade the visibility of facts during life-and-death crises, particularly amid the hatred-organization of a presidential campaign.

Examples: Elon Musk posted on October 4 that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was ""seizing goods and services locally and locking them away to state they are their own."" North Carolina's lieutenant governor (and now-failed GOP gubernatorial nominee), Mark Robinson, asserted on October 1 that ""Joe Biden told the people of North Carolina they had no more supplies for us."" Donald Trump at an October 3 rally charged that ""Kamala spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal migrants, many of whom should not be in our country….They stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season.""

None of these claims was true. Begged libertarian Republican Mayor Glenn Jacobs of Helene-ravaged Knox County, Tennessee: ""Please quit spreading those rumors as they are counterproductive to response efforts….If everyone could maybe please put aside the hate for a bit and pitch in to help, that would be great.""

But putting aside hatred of the faraway political Other is damnably hard to do when the venues for neighborly engagement have collapsed.

The Death of Local

While the center-right tends to blame the deterioration of media on the elites who run them, the center-left has an accusatory explanation of its own: that social media, with its algorithmic preference for consequence-free fearmongering enabled by Section 230 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, has incentivized bad actors, including populist conservatives and foreign ne'er-do-wells, to pollute the discourse commons, thereby eroding social trust.

""If we trust little or nothing because we can't tell the snake oil from the facts,"" warned Steven Brill in his 2024 book The Death of Truth, ""everything breaks down. We cannot have a democracy. Ultimately, we cannot expect a civil society."" Similar theses, presented with similar pessimism, were advanced this year in Renée DiResta's Invisible Rulers and Barbara McQuade's Attack From Within.

But the sheer magnitude and long-term relentlessness of the media implosion suggests exogenous factors far more potent, with implications far more interesting, than what theories lie on either side of the partisan divide. Sure, Vice News went bust after transitioning from billion-dollar Bad Boys to identity-politics scolds. But the reaper also came for the proudly Trump-supporting Santa Barbara News-Press. There are plenty of ways to go broke without going woke.

For most of our lives, the basic industrial unit of journalism has been the newspaper, with more editorial content, larger newsrooms, and fatter profits than the rest of the verification business (magazines, books, broadcasts, newsletters, websites) combined. In 1990, at the apex of the form, American newspapers employed nearly a half-million people, had a combined circulation north of 60 million, and enjoyed profit margins consistently above 20 percent. Even as those numbers began their initial descent after the end of the Cold War, newspaper advertising revenue continued its half-century climb until the dawn of the millennium to just under $50 billion per year.

All of that has since collapsed by around 75 percent. Combined newspaper circulation is down to 20 million, ad revenue is just over $10 billion, and employment is now well south of 100,000. Weekly newspapers are going extinct by a rate of two per week—and certain subspecies, like the alternative weekly, have all but disappeared. Dailies have declined from 1,600 to 1,200 since 1990, and those that remain are often emaciated facsimiles of their former selves.

The Los Angeles Times in 1990 was as thick as a phone book, with the largest print circulation in the country (1.2 million), an editorial staff of around 1,300, and bigger profits than any other daily in the world. By 2024 the paper was down to a few dozen frequently ad-free pages, with a print circulation of 118,000, a newsroom of 385, and a balance sheet bleeding $30 million to $40 million a year. An institution that once played kingmaker in the West—transplanting rivers, erecting downtowns, making the political careers of such figures as (believe it or not) Richard Nixon—is largely an afterthought in its own city.

And even that grim ledger undersells the shape of creative news-industry destruction, and what remains in its aftermath. Consumers abandoned their local news/advertising monopolies for more user-friendly digital alternatives as soon as they could—to Craigslist for classifieds, the Drudge Report for breaking news headlines, Usenet and descendants for community, Yahoo! and other search engines for accessing information. Even those few newspapers that responded nimbly to new technologies and changing preferences were never fully able to reassemble their old captive audiences online.

The upshot: When local newsrooms shrank, very little sprung up locally to take their place. The new internet office spaces were national, clustered disproportionately in a handful of big cities.

In 2017, right around the time when digital began eclipsing print across all measures, in trendlines that resembled the letter ""X,"" Politico Magazine ran a fascinating study of the journalism work force. Comparing the Bureau of Labor Statistics' media employment numbers with Census data and voting patterns, authors Jack Shafer and Tucker Doherty unearthed results that to them ""read like a revelation."" Namely: ""The national media really does work in a bubble, something that wasn't true as recently as 2008. And the bubble is growing more extreme. Concentrated heavily along the coasts, the bubble is both geographic and political. If you're a working journalist, odds aren't just that you work in a pro-[Hillary] Clinton county—odds are that you reside in one of the nation's most pro-Clinton counties.""

The digital jobs marching ever upward on those X-shaped graphs were, Shafer and Doherty found, overwhelmingly concentrated on the coasts—73 percent ""in either the Boston-New York-Washington-Richmond corridor or the West Coast crescent that runs from Seattle to San Diego and on to Phoenix,"" plus another 5 percent in the greater Chicago area. ""This isn't just a shift in medium,"" they wrote. ""It's also a shift in sociopolitics, and a radical one.""

The modal 25-year-old journalist was no longer a cub reporter covering and being accountable to the local community he or she lived among, but rather a graduate school grad lobbing insults at distant political figures from the relative safety of Brooklyn. As the nation itself was sorting geographically by politics, and retreating at measurable rates from community institutions such as church, Little League, and social clubs, journalism was refocusing on national and especially presidential politics, from the vantage point of the bluest neighborhoods in the bluest cities.

This reorientation has accelerated the industry's preexisting political trajectory. The American Journalist survey, conducted decennially, has tracked, among other things, the partisan self-identification of reporters since 1971. In 2002, the ratio of Democrats to Republicans among those surveyed was 2:1 (36 percent to 18 percent, with the rest being independent or ""other""); in 2013 it was 4:1 (28 percent to 7 percent), then by 2022 a whopping 11:1 (36.4 percent to 3.4 percent). Media are hurtling toward where academia has long been—a knowledge-creating sector of purportedly nonpartisan civil society where conservatives are nonetheless an endangered species.

The new generation of journalists entering the work force during the age of Trump has been at the vanguard of some of the profession's most head-snapping changes: an increase in unionization after decades of decline; the creation of departments dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion; out-loud opposition both to ""platforming"" people with unacceptable views and to ""bothsidesism,"" which can mean the consideration of multiple perspectives on a contested issue that journalists consider settled or just critical coverage of a given Democrat when everyone knows the applicable Republican is worse. Most ominously of all, we now see unabashed journalistic support for the government to do something about alleged purveyors of ""misinformation,"" First Amendment be damned.



These major shifts in how reporters are expected to comport themselves have generated episodes ranging from the startlingly illiberal to the unintentionally comic. In summer 2020, after Minneapolis police officers killed an arrest-resisting George Floyd, the knowledge economy erupted into dozens of managerial defenestrations over insufficiently demonstrative support for combating institutional racism. These purity spirals sent star talent packing to independent realms such as Substack and YouTube, bringing audience and money with them. As recently as this October we saw CBS descend into a series of internal struggle sessions and external managerial spats over a mildly combative morning-news interview about Israel with the celebrated writer Ta-Nehisi Coates.

""The good news,"" cracked National Review editor Charles C.W. Cooke at the time, ""is that the CBS that moderated this year's presidential and vice-presidential debates and the CBS that melted down because someone asked a non-progressive question on TV are completely separate and couldn't possibly both be affected by the same pathologies.""

But the political right has some major, giggle-worthy informational pathologies of its own.

Tucker's Journey

If the journalistic left reacted to the decline of the media by more doggedly policing its own orthodoxies, the journalistic right has doubled down on some unfortunate preexisting tendencies of its own, devolving from counterfactual skepticism to antifactual conspiracism. Nobody embodies this degradation more flagrantly, and successfully, than Tucker Carlson. Once among the most talented political-magazine journalists in the country, and then an intelligent if peripatetic cable news presence, Carlson has become a cautionary tale about how right-wing populism can warp media literacy.

In 2009, while ramping up toward the launch of his website The Daily Caller, Carlson was famously booed at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference for having favorable things to say about the The New York Times. ""This is the hard truth, and conservatives need to deal with this,"" he said then. ""If you create a news organization whose primary objective is not to deliver accurate news, you will fail….The New York Times is…to its core a liberal paper, [but] it's also a paper that cares about whether they spell people's names right, by and large. It's a paper that actually cares about accuracy. Conservatives need to build institutions that mirror those institutions.""

The Daily Caller developed into more a mirror of The Huffington Post than of The Paper of Record, landing somewhere in the editorial-quality neighborhood of Breitbart and The Daily Wire. But falling well short of an ideal is one thing; becoming what you once explicitly warned against is next-level.

Instead of holding as a primary objective the delivery of accurate news, Carlson in the past few years has, by his own admission, begun working backward from areas of perceived journalistic consensus, oftentimes asserting without anything like convincing evidence that the opposite of the consensus is true. ""The media are part of the control apparatus,"" he explained to the Full Send podcast in March 2023, shortly before getting fired from Fox News. ""And for too long, I participated in the culture where anyone who thinks outside these pre-prescribed lanes is crazy, is a 'conspiracy theorist.'…Their job is not to inform you. They're working for the small group of people who actually run the world. They're their servants, they're the Praetorian Guard.""

Such strident contrarianism can be a useful starting point for journalistic inquiry—an impetus to ask questions conformists would never pursue. Alas, in a pattern familiar to every ideological subgroup (including libertarians), Carlson has too often used his antiestablishmentarianism as a shortcut to false conclusions backed by wildly unreliable narrators.

In June 2021, the Fox host asserted that ""FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6, according to government documents,"" even though zero government documents, then or since, have made any such claim. (In June 2023, a former FBI assistant director testified to Congress there were ""a handful"" of FBI informants on the scene who had infiltratedsome of the Stop the Steal groups, but the rumor of any organizational activity was ""furthest from the truth."" A Justice Department Inspector General report on the matter was being slow-walked to the finish line as of press time.) In February 2024, the man whose father was literally the director of Voice of America under Ronald Reagan notoriously toured a luxurious Moscow supermarket and declared himself ""radicalized"" and ""legitimately angry"" at U.S. leaders for talking about how ""evil"" Russia was even though the groceries were so dang cheap (for Americans, anyway).

In September, Carlson touted his guest Darryl Cooper as America's ""best and most honest"" historian. Cooper, a podcaster, has published zero histories but maintains some out-there views on what Carlson described as the ""forbidden"" topic of ""trying to understand World War II""—namely, that Winston Churchill was the ""chief villain"" of the conflict. Some conservative journalists criticized this, but the Republicans who actually matter in national politics reacted with a brief shrug and then business as usual. Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts appeared at a Carlson live event within days; Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance joined Carlson three weeks later, and Donald Trump campaigned with the broadcaster multiple times during the final two weeks of the race.

Trump has been a one-man wrecking ball against the illusion that gatekeepers, whether in mainstream or conservative media, can establish and patrol the boundaries of acceptable political and intellectual decorum. From his summer 2015 poll spike after decrying some Mexican immigrants as ""rapists,"" all the way through a last-gasp, preelection bombshell from The Atlantic under the headline ""Trump: 'I Need the Kind of Generals That Hitler Had,'"" the GOP nominee's survival of every allegedly career-killing depth charge has illustrated that it's the consumers of politics and related news/commentary, not the producers of editorial content, who hold the whip hand. But what his own supporters have been slow to realize is that pulverizing political mores makes it much harder to hoist Democrats on their own petard.

The Wolf Who Cried 'Plagiarist'

On October 14, conservative antiwoke activist Christopher Rufo published on his Substack an analysis showing that Kamala Harris' 2009 book Smart on Crime (co-authored with Joan O'C. Hamilton) plagiarized more than a dozen passages, including from Wikipedia. ""This is a big story and should be treated as such,"" tweeted conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt. ""Plagiarism is a big deal and if she gets away with it, what's the message to every high school student?tag=reasonmagazinea-20"" The discovery, Hewitt averred, needed to be ""on the landing page"" of The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times.

Well, the Times indeed weighed in, but in a way that played right down to its critics' worst stereotype. ""Conservative Activist Seizes on Passages From Harris Book,"" went the headline—quite different from the paper's treatment of Sen. Rand Paul (R–Ky.) back in 2013 (""Senator Rand Paul Is Accused of Plagiarizing His Lines From Wikipedia""). We are told in the subhed about Harris' book that ""a plagiarism expert said the lapses were not serious"" (that expert later complained that the Times had given him incomplete information). Further in the piece, readers are encouraged to view Rufo as being corrupted by bigotry: ""part of a loose confederation of conservative writers and activists who, during the past year, have tried to expose plagiarism among academics, many of whom have been Black scholars who work in the field of diversity and inclusion….Some academics, however, have characterized the campaign as racist."" OK then.

Ideas Beyond Borders co-founder Melissa Chen quipped: ""I recall when plagiarism used to be something that ended presidential campaigns. That was 1988 though."" Indeed it was, and the vanquished campaign in question belonged to, as Chen pointed out, Joe Biden. But the differences between then and now go far beyond changes in newsroom sympathies.

For one, 1987 (when Biden angrily bowed out of the race) was at or near peak media power. If a politician's behavior or words were deemed beyond the pale by most newsrooms, then the prophecy would almost become self-fulfilling. Not only did Biden get hounded out of the 1988 presidential race by the press, but so did Gary Hart for his extramarital shenanigans on the yacht Monkey Business. Plus there was that Bernard Shaw–on–Michael Dukakis violence. Nine years of Trump have proven on a near-daily basis that that spell has been broken.

It's also true Biden's plagiaristic transgressions make those of Harris (or, more likely, her co-author) look trivial. The then-senator didn't just lift passages from other sources, he flat-out misrepresented other politicians' biographical details as his own and serially inflated his own academic accomplishments far past the realm of mere braggadocio. Twenty years later, the scandal (which was mostly downplayed as ancient history by a press enraptured by the prospect of Barack Obama's historic candidacy) nonetheless was assumed to put a brake on Biden's presidential ambitions. He was a safe and somewhat goofy elder statesman, there to add Capitol Hill experience to an inexperienced candidate, not the heir apparent come 2016.

As in so many other things, Trump changed all that. Biden's fabulisms, which never did go away (during the 2020 campaign he repeatedly lied about being arrested while trying to see Nelson Mandela, to cite one of many examples), were largely treated by a weakened if increasingly side-taking press as insignificant at best compared to the daily onslaughts from the incumbent. There is more than enough myth making, academic exaggeration, and outright fabrication in Trump's co-written business book smash The Art of the Deal to give Biden and Harris a run for their money, yet whatever dishonesty is associated with that project ranks roughly 3,000th on any list of Trump transgressions, from ""grab 'em by the pussy"" to ""stop the steal"" to his 34-count felony conviction for fraud (regardless of that case's dubious propriety). The whole value proposition of Trump is to outrage the sensibilities of the Acela corridor elite; weaponizing one of their parochial professional obsessions against his chief 2024 opponent over a 14-year-old book no one's heard of was just never going to go very far.

Rufo's work will also be greeted with suspicion by most traditional newsrooms because his muckraking enthusiasms are, by gleeful admission, unidirectional. Not only did the activist disclaim any interest in scrutinizing Donald Trump or J.D. Vance for plagiarism, but he offered in September a $5,000 bounty for any evidence proving that one of the GOP ticket's wildest claims was true: ""that Haitian migrants are eating cats in Springfield, Ohio."" Like Tucker Carlson working backward from media consensus, Rufo working forward from an unsupported Trumpian claim is a recipe for producing tainted information. Yet by treating his work with such blatant unfairness, The New York Times reinforced the suspicion that its work, too, can amount to glorified opposition research.

Revolt of the Independents

Gallup has since 1972 been asking Americans the question, ""In general, how much trust and confidence do you have in the mass media—such as newspapers, TV and radio—when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly—a great deal, a fair amount, not very much or none at all?"" In mid-October, the latest results came back: Trust is at an all-time low of 32 percent, tying the nadir from the presidential campaign year of 2016.

As independent journalist Matt Taibbi acidly observed, the news for the news industry was even worse. At 68 percent, the media's combined distrust number is one point higher than even Congress; and in the trust level of ""none at all"", it's a rout—39 percent for the reporters, 24 percent for the pols. ""It's impossible to overstate this embarrassment,"" Taibbi wrote. ""Asked about trust in a politician, 'None at all' is what people say when they expect nothing to get done. With media, it's what you say if you don't even trust a reporter to tell the time. It's an extraordinary indictment.""

Taibbi, a National Magazine Award winner who used to write for Rolling Stone, is one of the dozens of iconoclastic writing stars who felt pushed out of their perches in an increasingly conformist traditional media, and have since struck out successfully on their own. His December 2022 Twitter Files series of stories—uncovered after new owner Elon Musk gave Taibbi, Bari Weiss, and other independent journalists access to internal documents at the company—uncovered an elaborate, multidisciplinary system of government pressure on social media services to censor individuals deemed to be spreading ""misinformation"" about COVID-19, January 6, and other controversies.

The White House, largely cheered on by the new breed of anti-""platforming"" journalist, went on a censorial bender in 2021, with Biden accusing Facebook of ""killing people,"" Surgeon General Vivek Murthy announcing a ""whole-of-society"" effort to combat the ""urgent threat to public health"" posed by ""health misinformation,"" and then–press secretary Jen Psaki singling out a ""disinformation dozen"" ripe to be booted off platforms. As late as 2022, Psaki was urging Spotify to do ""more"" and ""be vigilant"" about removing the COVID-related content of the world's most popular podcaster, Joe Rogan.

Spotify, the leading audio streamer, mostly refused to blink in the face of White House pressure, Boomer-rock boycotts (led by Neil Young and Joni Mitchell), and the obligatory internal staff revolt. Through the Twitter Files and other investigative efforts (such as the Facebook Files, exposed by Reason's Robby Soave), a legal fight was launched by some of the censored COVID voices, though the eventual June 2024 Supreme Court decision in Murthy v. Missouri was dissatisfying to free speech groups. Substack, which has taken in so many refugees from mainstream media, has survived sporadic journalistic attempts to smear the outfit as having a ""Nazi problem."" The establishment revolt against the independents, when squinted at in a certain way, seems to be in retreat.

The final weeks of the presidential campaign produced supporting evidence aplenty for that thesis. Trump and Vance traveled happily to Austin for the full Joe Rogan experience; Harris, after failing to convince Rogan to come to her for a shorter interview, declined. 60 Minutes bizarrely published two wholly different Harris responses to a question about Israel (one on TV, the other online), then refused to share the unedited exchange. The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, and USA Today all decided last minute to not make presidential endorsements, triggering journalistic outrage about ""anticipatory obedience"" to the incoming authoritarian. And when Trump won decisively, a New York Times subheading warned that ""America stands on the precipice of an authoritarian style of governance never before seen in its 248-year history.""

But though the establishment may be greatly weakened, there is still some power left in the host—not in attracting audience, but in colluding with the government.



""I was invited to talk about risks to the First Amendment,"" Taibbi said at the September 29 Rally to Rescue the Republic in Washington, D.C., ""but to spare the suspense: That battle is lost. State censorship is a fact in most of the West. In February our European allies began observing the Digital Services Act, which requires Internet platforms to enforce judgments of state-appointed content reviewers called 'trusted flaggers.' Everything we found in the Twitter Files fits in a sentence: An alphabet soup of enforcement agencies informally is already doing pretty much the same thing as Europe's draconian new law."" The excesses of 2021 may have been rolled back, but as long as people in power agree with people in the withering rump of the journalism industry about the dangers of the rabble outside, speech squelching is inevitable.

Yet it will take more than just sturdy opposition to the censorship-industrial complex to grow a better informational ecosystem. The same Rally to Rescue the Republic that featured Taibbi also included Jack Posobiec, a popularizer of the ""Pizzagate"" theory that a D.C. restaurant was the secret hub of a power-elite pedophile ring, as well as fellow Pizzagater Lara Logan, who was banned from interviews on Newsmax in 2022 after saying during one that ""the open border is Satan's way of taking control of the world through all of these people who are his stooges and his servants….You know, the ones who want us eating insects, cockroaches and that while they dine on the blood of children."" People can rightly fight for the rights of lunatics without succumbing to lunacy themselves.

The unbundling of the newspaper has allowed consumers of political information to zero in on the people, material, communities, and delivery systems they find most valuable. The news outlets that survive and thrive—including, thankfully, the one you are reading—have adapted to this rapidly changing environment by enhancing unfettered access to audience favorites, jumping headlong into new technology and products, and above all not losing their ever-lovin' minds (or morals) in the face of political or peer pressure. If legacy media continue abandoning the field of trustworthy verification, there will be more room for new green shoots to spring up.

But only if consumers demand it. There have been markets for political information for as long as there has been politics, so it stands to reason those best at providing it—whether individual, niche group, or large corporate—will be rewarded with attention. The postjournalism era thus far has not been that great either for journalism or for politics, but the solution to both may just come from inside the house. Want a better media and government? Start demanding it.",center

This is an extraordinary comeback for Trump, who lost the electoral and popular votes in 2020 after stinging defeats in Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania.

This time around, Trump won back both Georgia and Pennsylvania. As of approximately 1 a.m. CST, Arizona and other important states have not been called.

Republicans also won a majority in the Senate, which will give them a key advantage as they work to confirm Trump’s cabinet picks and judicial nominations.

Trump won the presidency despite multiple obstacles, including being found guilty of felonies in New York, being indicted for election related crimes by a special counsel and surviving two assassination attempts. The election crimes case has yet to go to trial and will likely be dropped now that he’s taking office again.

Harris concedes presidential election to Trump

Donald Trump is once again president-elect, with more media outlets calling the election on Wednesday, Nov. 6. The former (and future) president not only won the Electoral College but the popular vote as well.

Download the SAN app today to stay up-to-date with Unbiased. Straight Facts™. Point phone camera here

As of early Thursday morning, Nov. 7, Decision Desk HQ had Trump standing at 312 electoral votes, surpassing the 270 needed to win. His opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris earned 226. Trump also led in the popular vote at close to 73 million, with Harris getting just over 68 million.

We heard from Trump celebrating his victory in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. Harris chose not to speak at that time.

Instead, the vice president waited until the afternoon to address a crowd of supporters at Howard University, where she conceded the election.

“The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,” she said, “but hear me when I say, hear me when I say, the light of America’s promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.”

Harris said she spoke with Trump on the phone to congratulate him. She also told her supporters it is important to accept the election results and engage in a peaceful transfer of power, calling it “a fundamental principle of American democracy.”

“At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States, and loyalty to our conscience and to our god,” she said. “My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say, while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign.”

Harris also told the crowd, they might “feel dark times are ahead” but she hopes that’s not the case and added that “sometimes the fight takes a while.”

Harris, as the sitting vice president, will be the one overseeing Congress’ ceremonial certification of the election in January.

Meanwhile, there is speculation Trump could soon begin announcing appointments to key positions in his cabinet, in just a matter of days. Some prospective nominees reportedly canceled their flights out of south Florida Wednesday after election night celebrations, in order to remain close to Trump.

Biden congratulates Trump on win, invites him to White House

President Joe Biden also reached out to President-elect Trump over the phone on Wednesday. During that call, he invited Trump to a meeting at the White House and offered his congratulations.

The White House released a statement saying, “President Biden expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together.”

A Trump campaign spokesperson confirmed the call, and that Biden invited the president-elect to the White House to “ensure a smooth transition between the current administration and the incoming administration.” The Trump campaign said the White House meeting would take place shortly and Trump very much appreciated the call from Biden.

Biden also spoke to Vice President Harris on the phone Wednesday. He released a statement following her concession speech saying in part, “Under extraordinary circumstances, she stepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what’s possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation.”

President Biden added that selecting Harris as his vice president was “the best decision” he made.

The president is expected to address the nation Thursday on the election and the transition of power.

This morning at 11 AM ET, I’ll address the nation to discuss the election results and the transition.

Special counsel, DOJ reportedly in talks to end Trump prosecutions

Now that former President Trump is once again president-elect, Special Counsel Jack Smith is reportedly in talks with Department of Justice leadership to figure out how to end the criminal cases against Trump. That’s what sources familiar with the matter have told several media outlets.

The DOJ has had a longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting president and Justice Department regulations say a special counsel must consult DOJ leaders — possibly even Attorney General Merrick Garland — on major decisions in an investigation.

Last year, Smith charged Trump with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and illegally keeping classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Those latter charges were dismissed by a judge earlier this year, but Smith has appealed that ruling. Trump has pleaded not guilty in both cases.

Biden admin rushing billions in assistance to Ukraine: Reports

The Biden administration plans to rush billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine before President Biden leaves office in January, according to multiple reports. The goal is to make sure Ukraine’s government is in a good place when President-elect Trump takes office.

Trump has been critical of the scale of the U.S. military and financial support for Ukraine in its war with Vladimir Putin and Russia.

In April, the Republican-controlled House approved more aid for Ukraine, including an allocation for weapons. However, more than $6 billion in aid that has been set aside for Ukraine has not made it there yet.

Trump has vowed to end the war between Russia and Ukraine quickly but has not specified how.

Fox News wins election ratings, overall viewership falls from 2020

The election results are in and so are the ratings.

Fox News once again led the pack, getting the most viewers on election night. During primetime hours between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET, 9.8 million viewers tuned into Fox News. However, that is down from the nearly 14 million viewers who watched in 2020.

On the broadcast side, ABC News came in No. 1 in primetime with 5.6 million viewers.

Overall, Nielsen said across 18 cable and broadcast networks, 42 .3 million people tuned into coverage. That’s down more than 25% from 2020, when election coverage drew nearly 57 million viewers.

Although, which presidential candidates poses the biggest threat to democracy depends on who is asked.

While most Democrats, Republicans and independents viewed the election as important to democracy, Democrats interviewed for the poll cited “grave concerns for the future of democracy” if former President Donald Trump wins the election this fall. Some cited a Fox News interview Trump had with Sean Hannity in December 2023.

During the interview, Trump said he would not be a dictator other than day one in office, if elected.

“No, no, no,” Trump told Hannity. “Other than day one. We’re closing the border and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I’m not a dictator.”

The findings in the survey suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy due to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as Congress certified the election results after President Joe Biden’s victory in November 2020. The former president has also vowed retribution against political opponents, which some who viewed him as a threat cited as another reason for their opinion.

Meanwhile, Republicans are holding presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris culpable for the actions of the Biden administration.

Trump supporters polled believe the Biden administration is the real threat to democracy, accusing the president and his allies of weaponizing the U.S. Justice Department against Trump in criminal cases and allegedly letting Biden off the hook for possession of classified documents.

No criminal charges were filed in the case.

Other findings in the survey showed that Democrats viewed the race for president as more vital to democracy. According to the poll, more than half of Democrats marked the election as “extremely important” for democracy. Only just 4 out of 10 Republicans and independents reported the same opinion.

Harris, Trump turn to PA with 3 weeks to go until Election Day

With just three weeks until Election Day, the 2024 presidential candidates are focusing on the key battleground states — and none may be as important as Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes.

Harris held a rally in the northwestern city of Erie, where Trump visited a few weeks ago. The vice president painted her opponent as a threat to American democracy, warning her supporters of what she calls the dangers of another Trump presidency.

“I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous,” she said. “Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged, and he is out for unchecked power. That’s what he’s looking for.”

Harris also urged Pennsylvanians to get out to vote early as mail-in voting is now underway in the state.

Also Monday, former President Trump spoke during a town hall in Oaks, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. He touched on claims he’s a threat to democracy.

“When they talk about a threat to democracy, how about where they take a candidate who won fair and square, they throw them out and they put up a woman who failed, was the first one to drop out of a field of 22 and got no votes?” he said. “And this is the person we’re running against. And she is not a smart woman. That’s true. And we cannot — we’ve had that for four years. We’re not going to have it for another four years.”

Trump cut his town hall short after two attendees required medical attention, with both the former president and moderator South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem commenting on the heat in the venue. Trump then requested music be played for the remainder of the event.

Trump will be back in Georgia on Tuesday as the focus on the battleground states intensifies.

Along with rallies, the candidates are continuing their media tour to reach voters. The vice president will take part in a town hall Tuesday, Oct. 15, hosted by the radio program “The Breakfast Club” and then she will appear on Fox News on Wednesday, Oct. 16.

Trump is scheduled to be interviewed by the editor of Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The former president has also indicated he will sit down with popular podcaster Joe Rogan before Election Day. Reuters has reported Vice President Harris is also in talks to be interviewed by Rogan.

More than 200 protesters arrested outside New York Stock Exchange

More than 200 protesters were arrested near Wall Street Monday after demonstrating outside the New York Stock Exchange. They were calling for an end to the conflict in Gaza.

The group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators staged a sit-in demanding an end to U.S. support for Israel’s war against Hamas. While none of the protesters got into the stock exchange, dozens did cross the security fence put in place by police.

A New York Police Department spokesperson said officers arrested 206 people.

At the same time, a smaller pro-Israel counter-protest was held at the site.

Since the war in Gaza started just over a year ago, more than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed and almost the entire population has been displaced, according to Gaza health officials.

North Carolina man arrested for allegedly threatening FEMA workers

Investigators in North Carolina arrested and charged a man with threatening to harm FEMA workers who were helping parts of the state devastated by Hurricane Helene.

According to the Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office, William Parsons, 44, is charged with “going armed to the terror of the public” — a misdemeanor.

In a statement, the sheriff said while initial reports indicated there was a group of armed militia members threatening FEMA workers, they found Parsons acted alone. Officials said he did have a handgun and a rifle in his possession when arrested.

The arrest followed misinformation and disinformation being spread about FEMA in the wake of the natural disaster and caused FEMA to change the way it was working to help people impacted by Helene because of concerns over workers’ safety.

Full Story

Democratic voters are still upset following President Donald Trump’s win and return to the White House. This has caused party officials to face challenges as they try to rebuild the party due to fewer people donating.

What are Democratic donors saying?

According to The Hill on Monday, Feb. 24, Democratic donors both big and small are holding back. Many said they’re still angry about November’s election results and unenthused by anything their party has brought to the table since.

Democratic donors told the news outlet, they’re not willing to pay for “no message” and “no forward-thinking.”

Why are they frustrated?

Much of the frustration stems from Democratic supporters who said they feel misled by the party following former President Joe Biden’s poor debate performance. The debate ultimately led to Biden dropping out of the race.

Donors also believed the campaign employed an outdated strategy, reminiscent of the unsuccessful one used against Trump in 2016. They said that was even an issue after former Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee.

What else could be causing a slowdown in donations?

Democratic Strategist Steve Schale acknowledged that “there is genuine frustration.” He attributed the lack of donations to fatigue from the latest election cycle.

Adding to funding troubles, charitable organizations that often support Democratic causes like voting rights, LGBTQ+ and immigrant rights are also pulling back support as they reportedly expect investigations from the Republican-led U.S. Congress.

According to The New York Times, slowdowns in fundraising are typical after a presidential defeat and before midterm races kick into full gear.

Registering would require a passport, birth certificate or identification that is REAL ID compliant.

Democrats contend non-citizen voting is already illegal and that there are sufficient penalties for those who break the law.

The bill would codify sections of an executive order President Trump signed that requires proof of citizenship. It also sets an Election Day deadline for mail-in ballots.

Full Story

House Republicans passed a bill that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. The legislation has broad support among Congressional Republicans and President Trump. However, it does not have enough support to get the 60 votes needed for approval in the Senate.

The bill prohibits states from accepting or processing a voter application without proof of citizenship, which includes: a birth certificate, passport or identification that’s REAL ID compliant as long as it indicates the individual is a citizen.

“We must ensure that it is easy to vote and hard to cheat,” Rep. Stephanie Bice, R-Okla., said.

Download the SAN app today to stay up-to-date with Unbiased. Straight Facts™. Point phone camera here

Republicans cite surveys that show a majority of Americans support requiring people to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote for the first time. A 2024 Gallup poll found 83% are in favor while 15% oppose it.

“Non-citizen voting reduces confidence in our elections. American elections are for American citizens and we intend to keep it that way,” Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., said.

Democrats raise concerns over bill

Democrats say the bill would make registering to vote a burden. They contend most people’s driver’s licenses do not comply and that it would end registration by mail.

“American citizens would have to appear in person, at an election office, bring with them various documents and forms to register to vote,” Rep. Joseph Morelle, D-N.Y., said.

“Think about it – just to exercise your fundamental, inalienable rights as a citizen of this country, Republicans would force Americans into a paperwork nightmare burying voter registration under a mountain of bureaucracy and red tape,” Morelle continued.

The bill creates new requirements for purging voter rolls. It also gives states free access to federal registers that contain citizenship data.

Republicans cite cases of non-citizens either registering to vote or casting a ballot. There were 13 individuals referred for prosecution in Michigan for non-citizen voting in the 2024 election, and over the years, thousands of non-citizens have been removed from voter rolls in Pennsylvania and Georgia.

Democrats contend this is not a problem to address.

“Federal law already requires people to attest under penalty of perjury that they are US citizens when they register to vote,” Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., said. “Non-citizens attempting to register to vote is exceedingly rare and if they do they face severe consequences including fines, up to five years in prison, and deportation.”

That includes individuals in key swing states who are facing felony charges.

There are 93 electors in seven swing states who pledged to vote for Trump if he wins that state’s popular vote. According to an analysis by Politico, eight of them are facing felony charges for signing fake elector certificates in 2020, five signed similar elector certificates but were not charged and at least six others challenged the results of the 2020 election.

Breaking it down by state, there are six electors in Michigan who took part in the 2020 scheme, five in Pennsylvania and two in Nevada. There are more Trump electors in those states and others who deny Joe Biden won the 2020 election. However, a fake electors scheme would be much more difficult this time around due to a law passed by congress in December 2022.

Some states also provide data on age, which shows that 75% of those who voted early are 41 and older, 16.7% between 26 years old and 40, and 8.2% between the ages of 18 and 25.

As for states that report gender, the trend shows that 54% of early voters are woman while 43% are men.

Unlike most Fortnite maps, Freedom Town has no guns—a design decision that has garnered both praise and criticism on social media.

Harris’ campaign created Freedom Town to connect with the 16- to 24-year-old demographic that comprises much of Fortnite’s 400 million registered players. The map saw a peak of under 400 users in its first 24 hours. That’s far fewer than the 323,000 users who played more popular maps like “Ranked Reload.”

In traditional Fortnite matches, players use various weapons to eliminate each other until only one remains. However, Freedom Town shifts the focus to collecting supplies, building structures and finding campaign posters and activities tied to the Harris-Walz campaign’s messaging.

Reactions to the map have been mixed. Some users on social media expressed disappointment over the absence of weapons, while others offered positive feedback. Gene Park, a gaming critic for The Washington Post, said the map was “more thoughtfully designed than you’d expect.”

This year, political campaigns have placed increased emphasis on reaching the “gamer vote.” Former President Donald Trump recently appeared on a livestream with influencer Adin Ross, attracting over half a million viewers.

ABC News is projecting that former President Donald Trump will win Florida's 30 electoral votes.

A crucial abortion access ballot measure is projected to fail.

Voters in Florida also cast their ballots in several down-ballot contests.

The state has long been considered a battleground, but has shifted more Republican in recent years.

State significance

Though Florida voted for former President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 and was long considered a battleground state, the state voted for Trump in both elections he has been a candidate. Florida has appeared to be shifting rapidly to the right since Trump’s 2.3% victory in 2020, with Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, cruising to reelection in 2022 by nearly 20 percentage points. Part of that shift has been attributed to collapsing support among Hispanic voters in Florida.

State Democrats hoped to put Florida back in play with the help of abortion access -- which was put directly before voters on the same November ballot as Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump. The ballot measure would have guaranteed expanded access to abortion, overruling DeSantis’ six-week ban in the state.

However, with 96% of the expected vote reporting, the initiative is projected to fail, leaving the six-week ban in place.

ABC News is also projecting that incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott will win. He was not expected to be threatened in his quest for reelection.

A historic election that saw an incumbent president drop his campaign, a woman rise to the top of the Democratic ticket and multiple assassination attempts against the Republican candidate will come to an end on Nov. 5.

But the outcome may not be known on election night.

It took four days for the race to be projected for President Joe Biden in 2020 as mail-in voting expansions, and other changes made to help Americans participate during a global pandemic, delayed counting in several key states.

""It can take a few days and sometimes more,"" said Barry Burden, the director of the Elections Research Center at University of Wisconsin-Madison.

An especially tight race, as expected this year, can make it even more difficult to project a winner in the hours after polls close, experts told ABC News. Polls show Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump neck-and-neck heading into Election Day.

Each state has its own rules to administer elections, including different ways to process mail ballots and deadlines for curing signatures or other issues, which means some may take longer than others to tabulate results.

538 has compiled a complete guide to poll closing times, vote counting and when to expect results in every state.

""There are a variety of things that have to be done because there are these safeguards in place to try and minimize the possibility of fraud,"" said Mitchell Brown, a professor of political science at Auburn University. ""And so in states that have those rules, it takes a while in order to process all the ballots.""

Trump, in 2020, prematurely declared victory before all votes were counted. Misinformation spread online about the integrity of the election as the country awaited a final result and Trump or his allies later challenged the outcome by baselessly claiming widespread fraud, particularly with mail ballots.

""Not knowing the result on election night is not an indication of election malfeasance ever,"" Brown emphasized.

All eyes will be on the seven swing states that will likely determine whether Harris or Trump win the Electoral College: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

In two of those states -- Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- mail or absentee ballots cannot even begin to be processed until the morning of Election Day. That includes opening envelopes, verifying voter information and preparing them to be scanned before they can be counted, which can lead to delays.

In 2020, Wisconsin wasn't projected for either candidate until the day after Election Day and Pennsylvania was called the Saturday after Election Day.

In other key battleground states, mail or absentee ballots may be processed but cannot be counted until Election Day, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes Georgia, Michigan and North Carolina.

In Arizona, a state that votes heavily by mail, mail or absentee ballots received before Election Day can be processed and counted upon receipt. But a sizable portion of those ballots get placed in drop boxes on Election Day, and those results may not be collected or counted until polls close, which may hold up a clear result depending on how close the race is.

In Nevada, another state where the presidential race wasn't projected until the Saturday after Election Day in 2020, some changes were made to help speed up vote counting -- including allowing mail or absentee ballots to start being counted 15 days before Election Day.

""It's really a product of the laws and depending where the Electoral College spotlight is in any given year, it can mean a faster count or a slower one,"" Burden said.

While news organizations often project a winner based on analysis of the vote count as its reported, results are not official until states certify them. States have their own certification deadlines, some of which extend into December, according to the Election Assistance Commission.

Recounts and legal challenges, especially litigation related to certification, could arise between a race being projected by media networks and the results being certified.

On Dec. 17, electors will meet in the states to vote for president and vice president.

Election officials in some key states are already warning that results may not come in on election night, and that it is normal.

""We will always prioritize accuracy and security over efficiency,"" Michigan's Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson recently said on CBS, estimating her state will be able to have a result by end of day on Nov. 6. ""Understanding how much people will want those results, we're still going to make sure the process is secure and accurate before we put anything out to the public.""

""We want to make sure we have an accurate count, and like we did in 2020, have a free and fair, safe and secure election,"" said Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on ABC's ""This Week.""",left

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are competing for 270 Electoral College votes to win the presidency.

The 2024 presidential election will come to an end in a matter of days.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump remain locked in a dead heat in national and battleground state polls, with all eyes on who will clinch the Electoral College.

Here is what to know about the process before Nov. 5.

What is the Electoral College?

As laid out in Article II of the Constitution, the president of the United States is elected by the Electoral College -- not the popular vote.

Under the system, each state is allocated a number of electoral votes determined by the size of its congressional delegation. The states with the largest number of electoral votes include California (54) and Texas (40).

Experts said the founders debated who should be trusted to choose the nation's leader, with some urging Congress or state legislatures to decide and others advocating for a more democratic vote.

""When they designed our system, they came up with the Electoral College not because they thought it was perfect but as a way to get the Constitution passed, and it satisfied the concerns of both the very populous states and lower populous states,"" Rachael Cobb, a political science professor at Suffolk University, told ABC News.

Though it's not a direct election of the president, they noted.

""It's really 51 separate elections,"" Barry Burden, the director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told ABC News. ""Every state and the District of Columbia has its own rules for running the election. Then each state awards its electors separately, and it's up to candidates to win a majority of those electors to be elected president.""

How do electors work?

To win the presidential election, a candidate needs to capture 270 of the 538 total electoral votes.

Many states have a winner-takes-all approach, meaning that whichever candidate wins the most votes statewide receives all its electoral votes. Two states, however, split their electoral votes: Nebraska allocates three of its five electoral votes by district and Maine allocates two of its four votes by district.

Electors are usually selected by the state's political parties.

While the Constitution doesn't bind electors to vote for the winner of the popular vote in their state, many legislatures have laws in place to prevent an elector from rogue -- or what's called a ""faithless elector.""

In 2020, some Republican allies of Trump tried to submit fake slates of electors to Congress to undermine President Joe Biden's victory. Several people were prosecuted for their role in the scheme.

Why is it so crucial to this election?

Polls ahead of Election Day show a razor-thin race between Harris and Trump.

It will likely all come down to just a handful of swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Some of those states were decided by just 10,000 to 20,000 votes in 2020, and the margins are expected to be just as close in 2024.

Pennsylvania is considered crucial to the outcome of the race, as it boasts the most electoral votes (19) of any of the battlegrounds. The state cemented President Joe Biden’s victory in 2020, flipping blue after going red for Trump in 2016.

If Harris wins Pennsylvania along with Michigan, Wisconsin and a single electoral vote in Nebraska (all of which Biden won in 2020) she would reach 270 electoral votes even if she were to lose the remaining four swing states.

If Trump wins Pennsylvania, and holds all the states he won in 2020, he would need to also flip Georgia to win.

What if there is an Electoral College tie?

A 269-269 tie is not outside the realm of possibility, though it's unlikely.

It's happened only once under the current rules of the Electoral College: the 1824 presidential election.

In that case, as the Constitution requires, Congress carried out a ""contingent election"" to decide the winner. A contingent election requires the House of Representatives to select the winner, with each state having one vote. A candidate would need support from 26 of the 50 states to be elected.

538 has analyzed the different scenarios in which a tie could result between Vice President Harris and former President Trump.

Cobb called the possibility of a tie a ""real concern"" this year and explained what would likely happen next.

""The House of Representatives is controlled by Republicans and so the likely outcome in this election, should it be a tie and should it go to the House of Representatives, is that the Republican nominee would win,"" Cobb said.

What about the popular vote?

""It's a symbolic victory to win the popular vote, but it's not required,"" Burden said. ""And twice in the last five elections, we've seen the popular vote go one direction and the Electoral College go the other. That could well happen this time as well.""

Candidates who lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College are John Quincy Adams in 1824, Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, Benjamin Harrison in 1888, George W. Bush in 2000 and Trump in 2016.

After the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton eclipsed Trump in the popular vote by nearly 3 million but lost the Electoral College, debate sparked about whether the system should change.

Pros and cons of the Electoral College, according to experts

Those in favor of the Electoral College generally note its written into the nation's founding document and has largely worked since then.

""Many aspects of the Constitution have not been changed since 1789 and are still in place. The Electoral College is still mostly operating the way it was originally intended. So why mess with success?"" Burden said.

Burden and Cobb noted it also forces campaigns to focus on traveling from state to state to meet voters. Without the need to win electors, presidential contenders would instead likely run a more nationalized campaign and focus on highly-populated cities while ignoring smaller, rural communities.

The main reasoning against the Electoral College is that it means not every vote is equal, as a handful of key swing states usually determine the winner of an election.

""Another argument is that, essentially, it has disproportionate influence,"" Cobb said. ""That smaller states have a disproportionately higher number of electoral votes relative to their population, meaning that individual votes in these states carry more weight than in those larger states.""

""The one person, one vote idea has really taken hold in the United States over time, and the Electoral College does not meet that,"" said Burden. ""Votes are unequal. Some voters matter a lot more, and others matter less. And that's inconsistent with really every other kind of election in the United States.""",left

Less than a week out to Election Day, both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are barnstorming battleground states, trying to reach and persuade undecided voters -- including independents -- to support them.

Independents are often swing voters, who may switch their allegiance from election to election. Statistically, they are a big enough group to make a difference in the results.

In a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll, 13% of independents said they were initially undecided. The poll also found Trump running essentially even with Harris among independents.

ABC News spoke with some of those independent voters who responded to the poll, as well as some undecided or formerly undecided voters who have been in touch with ABC News throughout the year, to get a sense of why they still feel undecided -- or what their decision was in the end.

Some brought up themes and issues that have been salient throughout the election, including the border and abortion.

Phyllis Allen, an independent voter who lives near Mobile, Alabama, and responded to the ABC News/Ipsos poll, told ABC News on Thursday that she is still unsure who she will vote for or if she will cast a vote for president at all.

She is leaning towards Trump, she said, because ""when he was in office, the last time, things were better for me and my family -- we've been struggling. it's hard, but since Biden has been in office, it seems like we've been struggling just to pay bills and just to buy groceries."" She said she also appreciated how she felt people were prouder to be American when he was president.

But how Trump has often spoken about Christianity has concerned her. Trump has often framed his potential presidency around being better for Christians than a Harris presidency, although he has also reached out towards other religious groups.

""There's so many religions in the United States, that's what the United States was built on … it's not fair to just push one religion,"" Allen said.

Allen added that she disagrees with Harris on border issues, feeling that if she is struggling to afford groceries or qualify for food stamps, it is unfair for undocumented immigrants to have any government support.

More broadly, she said she feels Harris could have already accomplished her policy proposals: ""Kamala Harris has been in there, and she's saying she's gonna do all this stuff, but yet she was already in office. Why didn't she go ahead... Why not now? Why wait until she gets to be president?""

But Allen aligns more with Harris on abortion issues. ""Roe versus Wade -- they need to reinstate [it],"" she said, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court overruling the decision granting a constitutional right to abortion in the United States.

""I mean, I don't personally believe in abortion, but it's not my decision to tell someone else what they could do,"" Allen said, later bringing up (albeit not by name) the story of Kate Cox, a woman who had to leave her home state of Texas to get an abortion to protect her health.

""A lot of Christian churches and stuff like that, they all say it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong -- but it's not their place to tell a woman what's wrong or right.""

Benjamin, an independent voter from Texas who also responded to the ABC News/Ipsos poll, said that he is leaning towards Trump but still trying to come to a final decision. (He asked that ABC News not publish his last name for privacy reasons.)

""I care a little bit more about my financial situation. And so, back when Trump was president, I remember that things were a lot cheaper for me than compared to when Biden was, but then at the same time, I don't agree with a lot of I don't agree with a lot of the way Trump thinks,"" he said, adding he agrees a bit more with how Harris thinks, although not on every issue.

Benjamin plans to try to vote early, although as a student who works part-time at a department store, he does not know if he'll be able to get to the polls before Election Day.

A voting sign is displayed near the entrance of the Millennium Youth Complex, Oct. 21, 2024, in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell/Getty Images

He said he tries to ignore the news, and feels news outlets are often biased, so he prefers to do his own research. He does not plan to vote down the ballot in Texas, which is also home to a hotly contested U.S. Senate race.

What could sway him to Trump or Harris? For Trump, he said, he'd have to find something positive that ""really sways me toward him in that way,"" while for Harris, he is looking for her not to be ""too extreme"" on issues such as immigration and abortion. (He said he believes in restricting illegal immigration but does want the border ""to be more open and make it easier for people to come over."")

Separately from the independents who responded to the ABC News/Ipsos poll, some of the undecided voters who have been in touch with ABC News throughout the presidential election season said that they've made a decision while others still feel conflicted.

Rebecca Bakker, a registered nursing professor who lives near Grand Rapids, Michigan, had already decided against voting for Trump but has not felt compelled yet towards Harris or any third-party candidates.

She told ABC News on Wednesday, ""I'm leaning libertarian, but I don't know by casting a libertarian vote is going to hurt or help either one of them."" (Libertarian presidential candidate Chase Oliver is on the ballot in Michigan. Bakker said she is compelled by the party's platform but not by its ticket specifically. )

She is still unhappy with Harris' position on the border.

""I think she's got to demonstrate that she's willing to work with both sides and maybe choke on the wall a little bit to avoid getting another influx of illegal immigrants. But she doesn't seem willing to even bend on that issue or willing to work with the other side,"" Bakker said.

Bakker acknowledged Harris is walking ""a fine line"" on how she can differentiate herself from Biden.

""I think she's struggling with separating herself from Joe Biden and making a name for Kamala Harris… I think that's what's going to drive a lot of people away from her.""

Conversely, on the Israel-Hamas war, Bakker indicated that her views are to the left of Harris' support of continued military funding to Israel.

""I understand Israel has a right to defend itself, but I'm really concerned that they continue to supply them with money and weapons when all the Israelis are doing are killing Palestinians in the hopes of finding one bad Hamas guy... So I don't understand this impetus to continue to fund that particular war because they're not making any progress,"" Bakker said.

Bakker said she may try to vote early, but may be more available on Election Day.

""Her closing arguments haven't quite pushed me over the edge,"" Bakker said of Harris. ""I'm not going to vote for Donald Trump. It's not going to happen, but a vote for Harris… I'll probably be forced to do it. I'm going to do it under duress, and hopefully we can dig out later. But she hasn't done anything to actually convince me that that's the best option.""

Matthew Labkovski, a Republican voter from Florida who supported former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley during the Republican presidential primaries, was still undecided as of early October. By now, he told ABC News in a phone interview on Wednesday, he's voted -- but ""just felt that I couldn't personally come to either candidate,"" and wrote in Haley.

Asked what Harris or Trump could have done differently to reach out to voters like him, Labkovski said he wished Harris had chosen Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate. Shapiro was among the final rumored contenders before Harris chose Walz.

As for Trump -- who he had previously decided not to vote for -- Labkovski said he was looking for Trump to acknowledge shortcomings.

""Maybe an apology, or some sense of remorse for anything -- not anything in particular, just that he was, he's human … things happen because things happen as a president, and I don't want someone who thinks that it's not their fault.""

Labkovski did vote down the ballot for the Democratic Senate candidate, former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, which he said was more as a ""wake-up call"" vote to incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott, and voted yes on Amendment 4, the proposition that would enshrine abortion access in the state's constitution. That would effectively overturn the state's 6-week abortion ban.

""I believe that it provides choice,"" he said, adding that as someone who plans to work in medicine, ""I think that there needs to be an opportunity for choice and for discussion.""

The gender gap is expected to play a key role in the 2024 presidential election.

Men and women have been voting differently in presidential elections for decades.

But could the gender gap be the deciding factor in this year's razor-thin race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump?

The final ABC News/Ipsos poll before Election Day, released on Sunday, found the gender gap among all likely voters to be 16 points. Harris had a 11-point advantage among women, 53% to 42%, while Trump had a 5-point advantage among men, 50% to 45%.

A 538 analysis of national polling crosstabs in October from its most highly-rated pollsters found the average gender gap was slightly wider: 10 points for Harris among women and 9 points for Trump among men.

That is on par with historical norms. The gender gap has averaged 19 points in presidential exit polls since 1996.

Some observers, though, believe it could reach a new level in 2024.

""With a woman versus a man at the top of the ticket and with the prominence of the abortion issue in the wake of the Dobbs decision, we could have a historically large gender gap approaching a gender chasm this year,"" Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican pollster, told ABC News.

The formula to success for Harris would be to win women by more than she loses men. The reverse is true for Trump.

""When you're talking about dead heat races in seven swing states, anything could be the deciding factor,"" Ayres said.

Both campaigns try to turn the gap to their favor

Harris has made reproductive freedom a centerpiece of her White House bid. In recent weeks, she rallied with Beyoncé in front of tens of thousands in Texas on abortion rights, visited a doctor's office in battleground Michigan and deployed high-profile surrogates like Michelle Obama to talk about the impact on women's health after the fall of Roe v. Wade.

""I think you can't underestimate the power of the abortion issue,"" Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster, told ABC News.

That's especially true, Lake said, among younger women. Harris has an overwhelming lead (40 percentage points) among women ages 19 to 29 compared with Trump's 5-point advantage among men in that same age range, ABC News and Ipsos found.

""They are registered in record numbers but we have to make sure they all turn out to vote,"" Lake said of Gen Z women.

Harris' campaign has also done extensive outreach to men, including Black men, through her economic proposals. Polls earlier this fall showed support from Black men for Harris was eroding from President Joe Biden's numbers with the group, though Harris has appeared to regain ground. In the final ABC News/Ipsos poll, Harris had support from 76% of Black men (Biden won Black men by 79% in 2020) and 87% of Black women.

Trump, meanwhile, has focused on driving men to the polls, particularly younger and apolitical men who vote at lower rates than other groups.

Both Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, sat down with popular podcast host Joe Rogan. Trump's surrounded himself with hyper-masculine figures on the trail, including Elon Musk and Hulk Hogan. He's embodied a strongman persona and doubled down on authoritarian rhetoric.

White men and women have long been among the Republican Party's strongest constituencies. Trump is leading with white men by 13 points, according to the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll, and among non-college educated white men and women by roughly 30 points. And while he leads with white women, the largest voting bloc in the U.S., Trump is only edging out Harris by 4 points: 50% to 46%. (Trump won white women by 11 points in 2020 against Biden.)

Trump has also ramped up efforts to court Hispanic voters, a demographic that has its own significant gender divide, more this campaign than in his previous presidential bids. The ABC News/Ipsos survey found an average of 55% support for Harris among Hispanic likely voters and 41% for Trump. (Biden won Hispanic people by 33 points in 2020, according to the ABC News exit poll.)

""I think Trump is trying to drive up his vote among men,"" said Ayres. ""I haven't seen a whole lot of outreach to women.""

The former president's recent messaging to women is that he will ""protect"" them ""whether the women like it or not"" -- a line that went against the guidance of advisers, whom he claimed had called the statement ""very inappropriate."" Harris quickly seized on the comment as ""offensive to everybody.""

Turnout will be key

More than 75 million Americans have voted early, according to the University of Florida's Election Lab.

Women are outpacing men in early vote turnout, the data shows, 54% to 43.6% as of Sunday. That is in line with past elections, including in 2020 when women made up 53% of the electorate.

Tom Bonier, a Democratic strategist and CEO of the data firm TargetSmart, said one notable takeaway is that women are voting early at higher rates than men by ""pretty substantial margins in every battleground state except Nevada.""

It is unknown which candidate early voters are casting their ballots for and unlike in 2020, when Trump discouraged mail-in voting, more Republicans are voting early this year.

But Democrats see optimism in the margins.

""There's just simply more women in the electorate and they turn out to vote more,"" said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked on several presidential campaigns. ""If you add in their preference for Harris over Trump, this should be very good news for Harris.""

The 2024 presidential race will come to an end in a matter of days.

Whatever the outcome, history will be made.

Vice President Kamala Harris would be the first woman to serve as president of the United States.

Donald Trump would be only the second president in history to win another White House term after losing a first attempt at reelection, and will have done so after being the first former president to be convicted of a crime.

""You hear inevitably every four years that this is the most important election of one's lifetime, but there is no question in my mind that this is the most important election of my lifetime, and probably the most important since 1860 when Abraham Lincoln was elected to the presidency and the fate of the country was in the balance,"" said ABC News presidential historian Mark Updegrove.

Updegrove attributed the historic nature of the race not just to Harris and Trump's backgrounds but, more importantly, to what is at stake for American democracy and diplomacy.

""I've never in my life, again, seen such a marked difference in what the candidates stand for and the policy positions they have articulated,"" Updegrove said, noting Trump's approach to those issues is a stark departure from any other modern U.S. leader.

It all comes after an unprecedented campaign for both parties.

President Joe Biden announced his reelection bid in April 2023 and easily won every state primary. But a historically-early presidential debate with Trump in late June derailed his campaign after a poor performance stoked Democratic alarm about his age.

Biden dropped out of the race in late July after weeks of pressure from his own party. He immediately endorsed Harris (the first Black and South Asian woman to be vice president) to take his place atop the ticket, and she officially claimed the nomination following an online delegate voting process in early August.

Harris, on stage in Chicago, said they are all in a ""fight for America's future"" in her acceptance speech.

""It is exceptionally rare for presidential candidates to swap certain roles in the middle of the campaign, period,"" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. ""It was a wild moment for an already crazy cycle.""

""Her nomination itself was historic,"" Rottinghaus added. ""If she wins, it will break barriers that the nation has been fighting to break since the 1920s. For a nation that has been more challenged in terms of race relations to nominate and then elect a Black woman is, by any counts, progress.""

Harris herself, however, has not made her race or gender a focal point of her campaign.

""That's smart because voters aren't interested in making history so much as being happy with where the country is going, and the voters feel very mixed,"" said Jim Kessler, the co-founder of the center-left think tank Third Way.

ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce, in the final week of the campaign, asked Harris directly what she thinks about the history she may make.

""I am fully aware of my gender and race,"" Harris responded. ""And I know that it will be very significant in terms of the glass that will be broken. But I do not expect that anyone is going to vote for me because of my gender or race. It has to be because I earn their vote with a plan to make their lives better.""

On the other side of the aisle, Trump announced his third bid for the White House way back in November 2022.

Since then, he's faced four criminal indictments -- one of which resulted in a guilty verdict by a jury of his peers in New York for falsifying business records in relation to hush money payments made to an adult film star in the closing days of the 2016 campaign. (Trump has vowed to appeal).

Trump also faced a Republican primary with more than a dozen challengers, including his former vice president, but most dropped out before the Iowa caucus and Trump won all but two state primaries. Trump accepted the GOP nomination in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, just days after he was shot in the ear during an attempted assassination.

""He's a study in resilience and defiance, resurging despite two impeachments, Jan. 6, criminality and consistently flouting democratic norms during his presidency and as a candidate,"" said Updegrove.

If he were to win, he would be the first former president since Grover Cleveland in 1892 to win a non-consecutive second term.

How will the history books write about the 2024 campaign?

""The Democrats were hungry for a win and despite having an incumbent president who was otherwise performing well needed to energize the ticket dramatically,"" said Rottinghaus. ""On the Republican side, Trump co-opted the Republican Party in a way that made his nomination inevitable. I don't think we ever had a situation like this in the modern era.""",left

When will we know the results of the presidential election?

Election Day doesn't mean its the day we will get final election results.

So when will we know the winner this year? That depends on two things: how close the election is and how quickly states count their ballots.

The trick is, each state is different: Some count quickly because of laws that speed up the process or a low rate of mail-in voting; others count slowly because they don’t have such laws, but do have a lot of mail-in ballots.

Pew Research Center conducted a poll on the topic in November 2020 and again in November 2024, in light of the latest election round.

As Statista's Anna Fleck shows in the chart below, the poll found that in 2024, voters were generally positive about how the elections were conducted and had more confidence in the results than in 2020. This change was largely driven by the sentiments among Republican Party voters.

You will find more infographics at Statista

In 2020, just 64 percent of Republican voters were confident that in-person ballots had been counted correctly. This figure shot up to 94 percent when survey participants were asked the same question in 2024 (after Trump won the vote), overtaking the confidence levels of Harris voters. Republican voters were even more skeptical of absentee or mail-in ballots in 2020, with only one in five saying that they were confident that such votes were counted correctly. This jumped to seven in ten (72 percent) in 2024.

It stands to reason that a higher share of voters will want to believe that their chosen candidate wins - something reflected in the responses of both parties of voters.

In 2020, 98 percent of Democratic Party voters thought the in-person ballots were counted correctly and 95 percent thought the same for absentee and mail-in votes.

While these figures dropped when Trump was elected in 2024, a large majority of Democratic Party in-person and mail-in voters still had confidence in the voting system and believed the outcome.

Even though 72 percent of Republican voters were at least somewhat confident that mail-in votes were counted correctly in the 2024 election, the figure is 6 percentage points lower than their counterpart respondents.",right

Biden notably withdrew from the race in July after a disastrous debate performance, after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and others pressured him to drop out. Democrats swapped in Kamala Harris, who suffered a major loss to Trump.

Biden and some of his aides still believe he should have stayed in the race, despite the rocky debate performance and low poll numbers that prompted Democrats to pressure him to drop out. Biden and these aides have told people in recent days that he could have defeated Trump, according to people familiar with their comments, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Aides say the president has been careful not to place blame on Harris or her campaign. -WaPo

That said, many Democrats blame Harris's loss on Biden's insistence that he stay in the race as long as he did, despite the fact that he's been an obvious vegetable for most of his presidency.

""Biden ran on the promise that he was going to be a transitional president, and in effect, have one term before handing it off to another generation,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told the Post. ""I think his running again broke that concept — the conceptual underpinning of the theory that he would end the Trump appeal, he would defeat Trumpism and enable a new era.""

Despite securing the Democratic Party nomination, pressure to drop out began to increase after a series of embarrassing gaffes - including introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

32,https://www.zerohedge.com/political/visualizing-how-trump-realigned-political-landscape,Visualizing How Trump Realigned The Political Landscape,"Authored by Joseph Lord and Terri Wu via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),

President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election was the result of demographic shifts that benefited Republicans.

Exit polling by Edison showed that Americans were more similar in their voting patterns this cycle than they were divided—the expected wide gaps based on gender, education, age, and race between Republicans and Democrats failed to materialize.

Trump ultimately was able to narrow these gaps vastly compared to 2020, concentrating on economic messaging that was compelling to a broad cross section of American political society.

Currently, the president-elect is projected to have carried all seven of the core swing states, bringing him up to a total of 312 electoral votes to Vice President Kamala Harris’s 226.

These charts show the shifts that gave Trump a second, nonconsecutive term in the White House.

Gender

This campaign season was unusually gendered in each campaign’s strategy.

Harris sought to target female voters, using the issue of abortion as a rallying point. Trump focused more on male voters, particularly young men, and appeared on podcasts popular with the demographic.

Thus, observers expected a substantial gender divergence that, ultimately, didn’t materialize.

In reality, Trump outperformed among both men and women, winning white men, white women, and Hispanic men outright and increasing

Education

Democrats have gained ground among wealthy, white, college-educated voters in recent years, and those trends continued in 2024.

This cycle, Harris gained among white college-educated voters, winning 17.2 percent of total votes cast for the presidential election from the group. President Joe Biden received 16.3 percent of his votes from the group in 2020, a 0.8 point shift. That’s unsurprising, as Harris targeted these voters.

Trump has also made gains for the GOP among non-college educated voters across racial groups.

Technically, Trump also lost a point of support from white non-college educated voters compared to 2020, though that’s within the exit poll’s margin of error.

But where he lost some among white voters, he gained among minority voters, including both those with and without college degrees.

Age

Traditionally, young people tend toward Democrats and older people veer more Republican.

That standard wisdom, however, was flipped on its head in this election: Harris underperformed with young voters, meaning those aged 18 to 29.

While Trump managed to win 18- to 24-year-old voters outright, 25- to 29-year-olds slightly favored Harris, bringing Trump’s total with the group to 43 percent—an increase of 7 percent compared to 2020.

At the same time, Harris made gains with older voters, winning voters aged 65 and older outright. The oldest voters reduced their support for Trump by around 3 percent, with 45 percent supporting the president-elect this cycle.

Race

Likewise, the Democratic coalition has historically relied on minority voters as a counterbalance to Republican-leaning white voters.

In this election, Trump again won among white voters outright, which was crucial to his sweeping victory, as the group made up nearly 71 percent of the electorate. White voters backing Trump accounted for 40.5 percent of the electorate versus Harris’s 29.1 percent.

However, Trump also made crucial inroads with other racial groups.

His vote share among blacks nudged up 1 percent in 2024 versus 2020, driven largely by shifts among black men.

33,https://www.zerohedge.com/political/biggest-supreme-court-decisions-2024,The Biggest Supreme Court Decisions Of 2024,"Authored by Sam Dorman via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),

The Supreme Court made a wave of historic and game-changing decisions in 2024 on topics ranging from presidential immunity to social media and ballot disqualification.

The U.S. Supreme Court in Washington on March 10, 2020. Samira Bouaou/The Epoch Times

The presidential election combined with rising administrative law disputes helped tee up controversies that put the court and its decisions in the spotlight. Legal precedent flowing from those decisions created rippling effects for other cases and how entire branches of government are expected to make decisions.

Here are several of the biggest cases this term.

Presidential Immunity (Trump v. United States)

One of the most politically controversial cases this term stemmed from President-elect Donald Trump’s now-dismissed election interference case in Washington. In Trump v. United States, Trump appealed the case with the argument that under the Constitution, presidents should enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution.

It was the first major Supreme Court precedent establishing presidential immunity since 1982 in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, wherein the court held that presidents enjoy immunity from civil liability for actions taken within the outer perimeter of his duties.

By taking up the case earlier this year, the Supreme Court created a lengthy delay for the pre-trial process and the case was eventually dismissed because of Trump’s election win. The court’s decision set a major historical precedent by outlining the contours of criminal immunity. For unofficial acts, presidents are not immune, while for official acts, presidents enjoy certain levels of immunity, according to the decision.

The majority offered some broad guidance on distinguishing between official and unofficial acts but acknowledged that doing so “can be difficult.” Chief Justice John Roberts said that lower courts should not inquire into a president’s motives and that they could not deem something unofficial “merely because it allegedly violates a generally applicable law.”

While courts should base their distinctions on what a president’s discretionary authority entails, some conduct could qualify “even when not obviously connected to a particular constitutional or statutory provision.”

Trump has attempted to apply that decision to his other criminal cases, including one still playing out in New York. For example, Trump argued in New York that prosecutors improperly used evidence, including testimony, that was prohibited under the immunity decision.

Appeals Court held a hearing on the former president's claim that he is immune from prosecution in the 2020 election case. Kent Nishimura/Getty Images

However, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan said that the evidence in question related “entirely to unofficial conduct” and was therefore not protected.

It’s unclear how exactly the new precedent should be applied, and future cases involving presidents could help iron out the details. While the Supreme Court offered a broad outline of immunity, it remanded Trump’s election case in Washington for further determinations by the lower court regarding specific conduct. The case has since been dismissed.

Ballot Disqualification (Trump v. Anderson)

Before the immunity ruling in June, Trump prompted another historic ruling from the high court in March. In Trump v. Anderson, the court wrestled with how to interpret a provision of the 14th Amendment that disqualifies insurrectionists from serving in certain government offices. The legal debate surrounding the topic was extensive with multiple critical points on which the court could base its decision.

Some argued that Trump, as a former president, wasn’t the type of “officer of the United States” who was subject to disqualification under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Others disagreed with the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision that Trump had engaged in insurrection—on Jan. 6, 2021—as covered by that section.

A unanimous Supreme Court ultimately held that states, including Colorado, could not disqualify candidates for federal office as Congress was responsible for enforcing Section 3.

Like the immunity decision, the decision in Trump v. Anderson also revealed divisions in the court. The court’s decision was 9–0 but justices produced separate concurrences that raised speculation that Justice Sonia Sotomayor might have initially intended to dissent.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett issued a standalone concurrence in which she suggested the court’s more liberal justices used overly heated rhetoric while agreeing that the court’s conservatives went too far in their majority opinion. Sotomayor’s concurrence, which was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, accused the majority of attempting to insulate all alleged insurrectionists from future challenges to their holding federal office.

Jan. 6 Obstruction Charge (Fischer v. United States)

Another high-profile case arose from Jan. 6 defendants challenging the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) application of a financial reform law in their prosecutions.

The DOJ had charged some defendants with violating the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which contains provisions related to document destruction and obstructing an official proceeding.

The section in question reads: “Whoever corruptly—alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding; or otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.”

The DOJ had argued that the second portion, starting with “or otherwise obstructs” allowed prosecutions that targeted obstructive conduct in a catch-all way that included methods other than those mentioned at the beginning of the section.

A majority of the Supreme Court, including Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, disagreed in Fischer v. United States and held the following:

“To prove a violation of §1512(c)(2), the Government must establish that the defendant impaired the availability or integrity for use in an official proceeding of records, documents, objects, or other things used in an official proceeding, or attempted to do so.”

It’s unclear how Trump and his DOJ will apply the Fischer decision to the defendants’ unique circumstances. Sarbanes-Oxley carries a 20-year maximum sentence.

In November, the DOJ said it was reviewing cases of “approximately 259 defendants who, at the time Fischer was decided, were charged with or convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 1512 to determine whether the charge should continue to be prosecuted.”

The DOJ said that after Fischer, the government “decided to forgo the Section 1512(c)(2) charge for approximately 96 defendants, will continue to pursue the charge for approximately 13 defendants, and continues to assess the remaining defendants.”

35,https://www.zerohedge.com/political/trumps-top-10-best-moves-2024,Trump's Top 10 Best Moves Of 2024,"Authored by Frank Miele via RealClearPolitics.com,

What a year it was! My first column of 2024 declared it “The Year of Trump,” and there was never a dull moment as Donald Trump aimed not just to take back the White House, but to stay out of prison and ultimately to stay alive.

Now that the election is over, it’s time to look in the rear-view mirror and contemplate why Trump is not just the greatest political comeback in history, but the greatest showman in the world.

So let’s consider Trump’s Top 10 best moves in the most consequential election of our lifetimes. It could easily be the Top 100, but that would be bragging.

No. 10: If we think of 2024 as an election season rather than a calendar year, then the first big move by Trump was skipping the Republican candidate debates starting in August 2023 and thus reducing his opponents to desperate Lilliputians in search of a Gulliver. Without Trump, the public soon lost interest in Tim Scott, Chris Christie, Mike Pence (remember him?), and Asa Hutchinson. Even Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Vivek Ramaswamy barely peaked out of single digits and were soon vanquished. The August debate on Fox News was the high point with 13 million sets of eyeballs, with each subsequent debate shedding viewers, until the CNN debate before the Iowa caucuses could barely muster 2.5 million bored spectators.

No. 9: After cementing his hold on the Republican Party’s base with his commanding primary performance, Trump moved to change the leadership of the party as well. On Feb. 12, he announced his desire to see GOP chair Ronna McDaniel replaced by North Carolina GOP chairman Michael Whatley, with Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump serving as co-chair. McDaniel had always had an arms-length relationship with Trump’s MAGA movement, and she was blamed by many in the party for not doing enough to ensure Trump’s victory in 2020, both before and after the Nov. 3 election, including her lackluster support for the president’s claims that the election was rigged.

No. 8: From the time he was indicted in the so-called hush-money trial in March of 2023, Trump realized that his popularity increased every time his enemies tried to put him in prison. Rather than resign from his campaign and concentrate on his legal woes, Trump wore each new indictment like a badge of honor. And he fought against the judges and district attorneys arrayed against him from his Truth Social page, calling them unhinged, corrupt, or simply Trump haters. Meanwhile, his attorneys battled in multiple courtrooms to prove not just his innocence, but ultimately his victimhood. When they argued before the Supreme Court that the president was entitled to immunity for actions taken while he was in office, the mainstream media portrayed Trump as desperate. This view was obliterated when the ruling came down in Trump’s favor on July 1, almost guaranteeing that most charges against him would be dismissed.

No. 7: The media also ridiculed Trump for campaigning in exceedingly liberal New York City. Once again, they played themselves for fools. Since Trump was spending so much time in New York City thanks to the Letitia James civil fraud trial, the E. Jean Carroll civil suit for defamation, and ultimately the so-called hush-money trial, what choice did he have? It should have been no surprise that the presumptive GOP nominee decided to campaign in his hometown. In April, Trump visited the Manhattan bodega where a clerk fatally stabbed a would-be robber and then was charged with murder by the same district attorney who had the former president on trial for vastly hyped felony charges based on the fact that he called payments to his lawyer “legal expenses.” Trump also visited a construction site and a local firehouse. But even better, and clearly one of the best moves of 2024, was Trump’s decision to hold a rally in the South Bronx while awaiting a verdict in the hush-money case. The Democrats’ smear against Trump as a racist looked pathetic as a diverse crowd of blacks and Hispanics joined whites to applaud Trump’s message of a stronger America.

No. 6: Seizing on President Biden’s ill-fated proposal to hold a presidential debate in late June, before either candidate was even officially nominated by their party, Trump again outsmarted the analysts. At the time, Trump was ahead in the polls and there was a general consensus that he had the most at risk in the debate. That perception proved laughable when Biden’s performance exposed him to be cognitively impaired and dangerously unfocused. In retrospect, some analysts think Trump made a mistake by debating so early because it forced Democrats to replace Biden as their candidate. Yet two simple words put that theory to rest: Kamala Harris.

No. 5: Harris’s inability to articulate a vision for the next four years and her refusal to separate herself from either Biden’s failed presidency or the radical leftist agenda of the Democratic Party made her an easy foil for Trump.

But in order to ensure that he would attract disaffected Democrats to his own campaign, Trump did something that would have been unthinkable eight, or even four, years ago: He reached out to Democrats and found common ground. Most significantly, he saw that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had been maligned and mistreated by Biden’s campaign, first as a Democratic candidate and then as an independent. Trump recognized that not just the Kennedy name but the Kennedy agenda would broaden his coalition and make him nearly unbeatable. When RFK Jr. suspended his own campaign and endorsed Trump on Aug. 23, the electricity was palpable. It didn’t hurt that the mainstream media hated Bobby Kennedy nearly as much as they hated Trump. Add that to Trump being endorsed by former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard and tech billionaire Elon Musk and it was clear that Trump was intent on building a coalition that could not just win the election but help him govern.

No. 4: While we are on the subject of campaign appearances, none made Trump more human and more endearing than his visit to a Bucks County McDonald’s restaurant in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania two weeks before the election. While trolling Harris’ dubious claim that she had worked for the fast-food chain while in college, Trump also proved himself to be a billionaire of and for the people. Donning an apron, Trump learned how to prepare French fries the McDonald’s way and served meals in the drive-thru window to delighted customers. The photo of the former president waving to fans outside the restaurant was one of the indelible images of 2024.

No. 3: You know you had a good year when surviving not just one but two assassination attempts fails to break into the Top 2! We won’t dwell on the second assassination attempt since the accused assailant doesn’t face trial until at least late in 2025, but no such qualms need bother us when talking about the shooting by Thomas Matthew Crooks at Butler, Pennsylvania, since Crooks was shot well and truly dead, as Hemingway might have put it.

When you are talking about Trump’s best moves that day, it is hard to ignore his head turning to the right to read an immigration chart that was displayed on a giant screen. Because of that fortuitous gesture, Trump was shot in the ear instead of the head, thus surviving what was very nearly a fatal blow. That was providential, but what the wounded candidate did next was pure Trump. After being helped to his feet by the Secret Service agents who had surrounded him, the bloodied Trump raised his fist three times and entreated the shocked crowd to “Fight! Fight! Fight!” This was the stuff of legends.

No. 2: Perhaps the most audacious political move of the 2024 campaign was Trump’s decision to outsource most of the Republican get-out-the-vote effort to two independent super PACs – Turning Point Action and America PAC. The Republican Party had always run a distant second to Democrats when it came to making contact with voters and getting them to the polls, but establishment pols thought the answer was for the Republican Party to spend more money. Trump counter-intuitively decided to spend less by soliciting the support of outside groups that would spend their own money and use their own volunteers to reach impassioned voters. Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point Action and Elon Musk’s America PAC were laser-focused on getting out the vote in the seven so-called swing states. The fact that Trump won all seven demonstrates just how successful the new strategy proved to be.

And at No.1 for Trump’s best moves of the year, it’s the Trump Dance! As the terpsichorean equivalent of Trump’s devil-may-care attitude, the Trump Dance was unleashed on the world at an unknown date, but it perhaps became most famous during the Oct. 14 campaign town hall when Trump decided to stop taking questions after two people in attendance suffered medical emergencies. It’s not unusual for Trump to halt his campaign rallies when someone is in distress, but in this case, after several minutes the crowd spontaneously broke into a chorus of “God Bless America.”

This inspired Trump to request “Ave Maria” on the loudspeakers, which inspired the candidate to then order an impromptu music fest. For roughly 40 minutes, the soon-to-be leader of the free world led the delighted crowd from the stage and added his unique dance stylings that mostly consisted of waving his arms with closed fists, swaying left and right and acting completely un-self-consciously as he mouthed the words to “Y.M.C.A.”

There actually wasn’t much dancing, but it inspired thousands of TikTok videos and the absolute disdain of the legacy media. MSNBC declared, “Questions mounting over Trump’s mental acuity after derailed event turns into dance fest.” Rolling Stone called the event “a bizarre instant-classic trainwreck.” So much for the perspicacity of the mainstream media, which had never understood Trump or his attraction. The real trainwreck of 2024 was the press coverage of Trump. And when multiple NFL stars performed the Trump Dance to celebrate touchdowns one weekend, it was obvious that Trump had won not just the election but the cultural war that had been declared against him in 2015.

Now it’s on to 2025, and it’s a safe bet that the coming year will be “The Year of Trump 2.0.” I can’t wait.",right

With just weeks to go until the general election, election offices across the country are making their final preparations, and in some cases, accepting ballots.

Here are the answers to some common questions voters may have as they gear up to cast their ballots.

When Is Election Day?

Election Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5.

Who Can Vote?

Only U.S. citizens ages 18 or older are permitted to vote in federal elections.

Can I Vote Early?

That depends on your state.

Most states offer early or absentee voting for any reason, though a few (Alabama, Mississippi, and New Hampshire) require voters to meet certain eligibility requirements.

To vote absentee, you will need to request a ballot before your state’s deadline unless you live in one of a handful of states that automatically mail out ballots to all voters.

Those states include California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia, which allow all elections to be conducted by mail.

You can check your eligibility and request an absentee ballot through your local election office or via Vote.org. Ballots can be returned via mail, in-person at your local election office, or via a drop box, if your state uses them.

In most states, you can track the status of your absentee ballot online. Some may also offer text or email alerts to keep you updated as your ballot is processed.

Early in-person voting is also available in most states, though dates vary. Check this calendar to see when early voting begins and ends in your state.

What Do I Need to Do?

The first step to voting—early or otherwise—is to make sure you are registered. All states and territories, save North Dakota, require voters to register.

You can check the status of your voter registration here. Online registration is also available up until your state’s deadline.

Most states also either require or request that voters present some form of ID to vote in person, though rules vary.

In some cases, voters may be allowed to vote without any form of identification. Check your state’s requirements here.

Lastly, before heading to the polls, verify your polling location and the hours it will open with your local elections office.

What Are the Top Races?

With control of the House, Senate, and White House up for grabs, there are many races on this year’s ballot that could prove critical to the balance of power in Washington.

Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris is seeking a promotion to the role of president, while former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, is hoping to secure a second term.

Their running mates, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio will also be on the ballot.

On Capitol Hill, Republicans’ control of the House and the Democrat majority in the Senate are both hanging by a thread.

With all 435 House seats up for election, Democrats need only flip four to take control of the chamber.

New York’s 4th Congressional District is one place they are eyeing for a gain.

There, freshman Rep. Anthony D’Esposito, a Republican, is defending his seat against Democrat Laura Gillen, former Hempstead town supervisor, in a rematch of 2022.

The race for Arizona’s 1st District seat, currently held by Republican Rep. David Schweikert, is another where Democrats could pull off an upset.

Schweikert won the district by about 3,200 votes in 2022—a thin margin that could bode well for his Democrat challenger, former state Rep. Amish Shah.

Republicans, on the other hand, are hoping to expand their majority by flipping Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, where former NASCAR driver and Republican state lawmaker Austin Theriault is taking on three-term Democrat Rep. Jared Golden.

Pennsylvania’s 8th District is also on Republicans’ radar.

Trump carried the district twice, and with the 45th president on the ballot again, Democrat Rep. Matt Cartwright could lose his seat to Republican businessman Rob Bresnahan.

In the Senate, Republicans are targeting the seats of several vulnerable Democrats and independents in hopes of retaking the upper chamber.

One they are expected to win handily is the seat of West Virginia’s newly independent Sen. Joe Manchin, who is not seeking reelection.

Before Manchin’s affiliation change in May, he was West Virginia’s sole remaining Democrat in a statewide office.

Although he endorsed Wheeling’s Democrat Mayor Glenn Elliott to take his place, West Virginians are widely expected to pick Republican Jim Justice, the current governor, to fill the seat.

In Montana, another GOP stronghold, Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is in danger of losing his race against Republican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL and entrepreneur.

The latest RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Tester trailing his challenger by more than 5 points.

Ohio’s Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown is in a similar position. He’s defending his seat against Trump-endorsed entrepreneur Bernie Moreno in another state that tends to lean Republican.

However, in that case, the RealClearPolitics average of polls favors Brown by 3.6 points.

Meanwhile, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) are looking to stave off Democrat challengers in two reliably red states.

And the race to replace Arizona’s independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is also sure to be closely watched, with Trump ally and former gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake set to take on Democrat Rep. Ruben Gallego.

Other Senate battlegrounds include Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Wisconsin.

When Will We Know Results?

With the recent rise in the popularity of mail-in voting, it’s unlikely every race will be decided on election night.

Each state has different laws governing how long absentee ballots may be accepted and when election offices may start counting them.

Some states allow that process to begin before Election Day, whereas others require officials to wait until after the polls close.

Because of those rules, counting continued days past Election Day in many states in 2020, prompting questions about the accuracy and validity of the results.

The U.S. Postal Service encourages those voting by mail to mail their completed ballots before Election Day and at least one week before their state’s deadline to ensure their vote is counted.

Former United States President Donald Trump’s lead on the top blockchain-based betting market is nearing 67% as a mysterious whale continues to bet on his victory in the upcoming presidential election on Nov. 5.

Trump’s odds of winning the election surpassed 66.3% on the leading decentralized predictions market on Oct. 28, according to Polymarket data.

Trump’s odds increased after a Polymarket whale, or large holder, invested another $2 million worth of USD Coin USDC$1.00 tokens into pro-Trump bets.

The mysterious whale has spent $7.22 million on “Yes” shares, according to onchain intelligence firm Lookonchain, which wrote in an Oct. 28 X post:

“Since Oct 11, the whale has spent 7.22 million $USDC to buy 11.28 million ‘Yes' shares on Donald Trump winning the US election, with an unrealized profit of $256,000.”

With only seven days until the 2024 US presidential election, decentralized prediction markets may offer more accurate predictions than traditional polling systems, according to billionaire Elon Musk.

The Polymarket odds flipped in Trump’s favor on Oct. 4, marking a sharp reversal from September. By Oct. 12, Trump was leading by over 10 points, Cointelegraph reported.

Mysterious Polymarket whale seems unrelated to “Fredi9999”

The mysterious Polymarket whale, known as “zxgngl,” holds over 11.2 million “Yes” votes worth over $7.5 million, according to Polymarket data.

The increasing positions come after the top Trump bettor on Polymarket, “Fredi9999,” bolstered Trump’s odds above 60.2% by buying over $20 million worth of “Yes” shares up to Oct. 18.

Moreover, Fredi’s transaction patterns suggest that it controls four of the six largest Trump-voting accounts on Polymarket, all funded with Kraken deposits.

While 99% of zxgngl’s bets were also placed on Trump, their account was funded by Binance, not the Kraken exchange. Their transaction patterns are also different, with the last two Binance deposits being worth $338,000 and $1.68 million, respectively.

As for Fredi, the account is likely controlled by a person with deep confidence in a Trump victory, according to pseudonymous political bettor Domer, who told Cointelegraph:

“My guess is it is a true believer who is very rich and trying to make a big bet. He is getting more confident as the price goes higher and is in a confirmation bias loop where new information keeps increasing his confidence.”

US presidential elections fuel 565% prediction market growth

The upcoming US elections have boosted investor interest in prediction markets.

The betting volume on prediction markets rose over 565.4% in the third quarter to reach $3.1 billion across the three largest markets, up from just $463.3 million in the second quarter.

The run-up to the 2024 election has seen a number of consequential court cases and rulings related to how voters cast their ballots and how governments process the election results.

Some of the cases remain ongoing, and if 2024 is anything like 2020, the nation could see a flurry of lawsuits after Election Day with candidates also challenging the outcomes.

Illustration by The Epoch Times, Getty Images, Shutterstock

It is, however, unclear how far any legal case will go, with experts doubting that a Supreme Court case will result from the ongoing slate of legal challenges.

“Judges throughout the country ... are loath to be perceived as disenfranchising individuals,” Landmark Legal Vice President of Legal Affairs Mike O’Neill told The Epoch Times.

“If they have an exit ramp to either dismiss a case or a procedural exit ramp to dismiss a case, they’re going to take [it]—even despite the fact that there might be evidence of either some sort of failure to follow proper procedures or failure to follow necessary registration procedures.”

Here are some legal issues to watch heading into November.

Mail-In or Absentee Ballots

Perhaps the most contentious election issue in 2020 was the widespread use of mail-in ballots, brought on by the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A survey from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, a federal body established by Congress, showed that the number of mail-in ballots increased by 20 percent between 2016 and 2020.

“Because we’re no longer in the COVID situation, we’re not going to see the same level of court-driven outcomes in our elections,” Public Interest Legal Foundation President J. Christian Adams told The Epoch Times. “I think that’s the big difference between now and 2020.”

A recent lawsuit in Pennsylvania, one of the more hotly contested states in 2020, dealt with how to process mail-in ballots that lack proper dates and other information. A practice known as ballot curing allows voters to correct deficiencies in their ballots after submitting them.

“Ballots come in, they take quite a bit more processing, making sure that it’s the person who voted to send him in all those things, and so it’s just a slower process,” Honest Elections Project Vice President Chad Ennis told The Epoch Times.

Earlier this month, the state supreme court declined to hear Republicans’ challenge to the state notifying voters of deficiencies in their ballots.

In Nevada and Mississippi, similar challenges surround ballots received after Election Day.

The issue reached the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which heard arguments in September over the Republican National Committee’s (RNC’s) claim that Mississippi should not count those ballots—even if properly postmarked.

Texas passed an omnibus election security package in 2021 with provisions that were halted by a district court judge this month.

More specifically, Judge Xavier Rodriguez blocked Texas from preventing compensation for assisting voters with their mail-in ballots.

He also enjoined a restriction on compensation for vote harvesting services, which the law defined as “in-person interaction with one or more voters, in the physical presence of an official ballot or a ballot voted by mail, intended to deliver votes for a specific candidate or measure.”

Both provisions violated the Voting Rights Act, according to Rodriguez.

In Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, Republicans have also filed lawsuits challenging ballots submitted from individuals who are overseas.

A law known as the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act requires states to allow ballots from Americans who live overseas, but Republicans have argued that state officials in North Carolina and Pennsylvania are illegally exempting overseas Americans from verification requirements.

They similarly argued that Michigan officials have registered people who don’t reside in the state.

Certification

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney heard arguments on Oct. 1 over Democrats’ challenge to Georgia state election board policies surrounding certification.

One of the rules requires officials to make a “reasonable inquiry” before certifying the results while another allows officials to review documentation “created during the conduct of elections.”

McBurney seemed inclined to uphold the rules but with clarification of the reasonable inquiry rule, which he said was “vague.”

On Oct. 15, he issued a ruling stating that election superintendents couldn’t refuse to certify election results or abstain from doing so, even under Georgia’s new rule.

He added that delays in election officials receiving information related to the election was “not a basis for refusing to certify the election results or abstaining from doing so.”

Another ruling by McBurney, on Oct. 15, held that the Georgia election board had acted too closely to an election when it tried to impose a rule requiring ballots be counted by hand.

The following day, Superior Court Judge Thomas Cox issued a ruling invalidating that rule and six others from the state election board—including the one requiring election officials to conduct a “reasonable inquiry.” The RNC quickly appealed the decision.

Voter Rolls

The Department of Justice has sued both Alabama and Virginia over their attempts to clean up their state’s voter rolls prior to the election.

On Oct. 16, a federal judge in Alabama halted the state’s program with a preliminary injunction.

Both lawsuits cite something known as the “Quiet Period Provision” of the National Voter Registration Act, which says: “A state shall complete, not later than 90 days prior to the date of a primary or general election for Federal office, any program the purpose of which is to systematically remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters.”

Multiple disputes over election rolls have emerged in Arizona, where election officials found that nearly 100,000 voters were able to vote despite not providing proof of citizenship.

The U.S. Supreme Court intervened in August by halting the effects of a lower court decision that blocked Arizona’s law requiring officials to reject state voter registration forms that lacked proof of citizenship.

More recently, a federal judge ruled against an Arizona group’s legal effort to force county officials to investigate ahead of the upcoming general election whether more than 40,000 registered voters are U.S. citizens.

The RNC has raised other allegations about noncitizen voting in Maine as well as Nevada, where the RNC and the Trump campaign sued the secretary of state.

Hearings in the Fifth Circuit and Georgia have also raised questions about the Purcell principle, which comes from the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2006 decision in Purcell v. Gonzalez.

It generally cautions against election policy changes just before voters head to the polls.

The court’s opinion didn’t set out a specific timetable for allowable changes to election procedures. Instead, it reversed an appeals court decision striking down Arizona’s voter ID law.

“This year, we do expect that it will take between 10 and 13 days to complete tabulation of all of the ballots that come in,” she said.

“We want to make sure that this is a secure process, but we also want to make sure that it is an accurate process.”

Assistant Maricopa County Manager Zach Schira said at the press conference, “If I have one message for voters here today, it is this: that the longer ballots and higher interest in this 2024 general election will create longer lines on Election Day, and that’s okay.”

Schira said that if people want to avoid the long lines, they are advised to vote by mail or early in person.

Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates said the tabulation may take so long because the ballot is two pages, there are dozens of contests per ballot, and there is heightened interest in the presidential election. He said more than 2.1 million Maricopa voters are expected to cast their ballot for the Nov. 5 contest, noting that 400,000 people so far have voted.

The “top message for voters” on Oct. 22 is “if you want to save time and avoid lines, vote early,” the county wrote on social media platform X. Voters have until Oct. 25 to request an early ballot, it noted.

Early voting data compiled by the University of Florida show that Republicans have a 38,000-vote advantage in terms of early voting in Arizona. Only mail-in ballots have been returned so far, but the data show that 41.9 percent of early ballots have been submitted by Republicans, compared with 36.3 by Democrats. Independent or third-party voters make up about 21.8 percent of the total.

Arizona, considered a battleground state, is again expected to be a close race during the 2024 election. State election officials in 2020 certified the race in Arizona for Joe Biden over President Donald Trump by a margin of about 11,000 votes.

In the aftermath of the 2020 contest, Trump and other Republicans alleged that Arizona’s election was marred by voter fraud, sparking a number of lawsuits against Arizona and Maricopa County officials that were all ultimately dismissed.

For that election, county officials certified the results 17 days after Election Day, according to a statement issued on Nov. 20, 2020. A significant number of voters cast ballots early in person or by mail in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated stay-at-home and lockdown orders and rules.

Maricopa County, which encompasses the city of Phoenix, is by far the most populous area in Arizona. As of March, it had more than 4.5 million residents, which is more than half the state’s entire population.

Trump is expected to campaign in Arizona on Oct. 24, holding a rally at Arizona State University’s arena in Tempe. Harris visited Arizona near the U.S.–Mexico border in late September.

Before his trip to Arizona, Trump is scheduled to headline a rally in Duluth, Georgia, on Oct. 23 with guests Tucker Carlson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Vice President Kamala Harris is also focusing on battleground states and will be traveling to the outskirts of Philadelphia to participate in a live CNN town hall event with undecided voters from Pennsylvania. An interview she recorded with Telemundo, a Spanish language network, on Oct. 22 is also due to air.

40,https://www.dailywire.com/news/donald-trump-defeats-kamala-harris-wins-back-the-white-house,"Donald Trump Defeats Kamala Harris, Wins Back The White House","WEST PALM BEACH—Former President Donald Trump won the 2024 election, Decision Desk HQ predicts, completing what is likely the biggest political comeback in American history.

Despite suggestions that the race would be incredibly close, Trump took off with an early lead, quickly winning majorities in the key swing states of Georgia and North Carolina, and showing early dominance in Pennsylvania.

When the race was called just past 1:00 a.m. on the east coast, Trump had won three of seven swing states — Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania — putting him at 270 Electoral College votes. He is set to take the stage at his election night party early morning on Wednesday.

Campaign officials and advisers celebrated Trump’s victory late into the night on Tuesday and early Wednesday in West Palm Beach, Florida, at an election night party for the former and future president.

Trump, who also won the 2016 presidential election, will return to the White House after a four-year absence, after Harris and President Joe Biden won in 2020.

For years, critics on the right protested that Biden’s mental acuity made him unfit to serve as president. Media and top Democrats turned a blind eye to the president’s decline until this summer, when he was ousted as the Democratic nominee and replaced with Harris.

Harris refused to concede Tuesday night, sending her campaign co-chair to the dwindling crowd at Howard University in Washington, D.C., to announce that the vice president would not be speaking.

This presidential election cycle has been one of the most vitriolic and aggressive in American history. Trump faced not one but two assassination attempts, and was shot in the ear by an assassin who narrowly missed the president’s head.

In a tense moment, the bloodied Trump fell to the ground as the Secret Service dove to protect him. He then rose, and in a historic, viral moment, defiantly shook his fist to the crowd, shouting, “Fight, Fight, Fight!” Trump supporters saw the moment as a show of strength, and a refusal to give in to political persecution.

Trump ran on a platform that promised to Make America Great Again. He has promised to seal the border and stop the immigration crisis by carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history. He promises to “make America affordable again” by ending the inflation Americans have seen throughout the Biden administration.

He’s also promised to make America the dominant energy producer in the world, to turn the United States into a “manufacturing superpower,” to cut tax on tips for workers, clean up American cities, strengthen and modernize the military, and more.

The next president similarly promises to defend the Constitution and fundamental American freedoms, such as freedom of speech, of religion, the right to keep and bear arms, and more.

He promises to cut federal funding for any school pushing radical ideology, whether racial, sexual, or political, upon children, and to keep men out of women’s sports.

Trump also has vowed to prevent another world war, to restore peace in both Europe and the Middle East, and to deport “pro-Hamas radicals” active on American campuses. He promises to secure American elections, and to end the weaponization of the government against United States citizens.

His campaign platform’s final promise is to “unite our country by bringing it to new and record levels of success.” Republicans also took back control of the Senate, clinching at least 51 seats.",right
41,https://www.dailywire.com/news/race-for-the-senate-here-are-the-paths-for-each-party-in-2024,Race For The Senate: Here Are The Paths For Each Party In 2024,"The 2024 election has focused almost entirely on the tight competition between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, but multiple Senate races — which will determine which party controls the chamber — are also neck-and-neck.

While projections and polling don’t win or lose elections, they do show the most viable path forward for each party. And with just 18 days until Election Day, the most accessible road to control of the Senate is the road under Republicans’ feet.

Currently, Democrats hold control of the Senate with 51 lawmakers, including four independents, in their caucus. Independent West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s decision to retire, along with Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester facing a tough GOP challenger, put Democrats in a difficult spot to maintain control.

According to Cook Political Report’s Senate race ratings, Republicans are favored to flip the seats in West Virginia and Montana. If those two races go in the Republicans’ favor, and the GOP holds on to the seats in races they are projected to win, Republicans would be at a 51-seat majority.

Cook Political Report also currently rates the races for the Democrat-held seats in Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin as “toss-ups,” giving the GOP an even wider window to take control of the Senate. None of the races where a Republican currently holds the seat are rated as a “toss-up,” according to Cook Political Report. Democrats’ best chance to flip a Senate seat comes in Texas with Democratic Rep. Colin Allred facing Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, but even in that race, Cruz holds a four-point lead over his Democrat opponent, per the RealClearPolitics average.

The best path for Democrats to maintain control of the Senate would require that the party holds onto each of the “toss-up” seats while also pulling off an upset in one of the “lean or likely Republican” races: Montana, Texas, or Florida.

Here is the 2024 Senate map based on Cook Political Report’s ratings (brown = toss-up):

The only other Senate race in which Democrats could come close, according to projections, is in Florida — where Republican Sen. Rick Scott is running for a second term. According to the RCP average, Scott holds a 6-point lead over Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell.

In Nebraska, Republican Sen. Deb Fischer is running for a third term against an independent candidate. The Nebraska Senate race has flown under the radar, but it could be close as some polls show independent Dan Osborne leading Fischer. Osborne said he would not accept an endorsement from the Democratic Party in the race, adding that he would not caucus with either party if he wins the Senate seat. Even though he’s not a Democrat, an Osborne win in Nebraska would make the GOP’s path to Senate control more complicated.

Republicans would also gain control of the Senate if it splits 50-50 and Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) win the presidential election. If Vance ascends to the vice presidency, Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine would appoint his successor until a special election could be held in 2026. Democrats would maintain control of the Senate in a tie if Harris and Gov. Tim Walz win.

In Michigan, Republican Mike Rogers, a former congressman, has closed the gap in polling against Democrat Rep. Elissa Slotkin. The Michigan Democrat only holds a 2.7-point lead in the RCP average after leading Rogers by 5 points in mid-September. Earlier this month, the Wisconsin race between Republican Eric Hovde and Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin moved from “lean Democrat” to “toss-up,” according to Cook Political Report. The Ohio Senate race between Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican Bernie Moreno is also considered a “toss-up,” as Brown leads by fewer than 3 points, according to the RCP average.

Republicans have a chance to pull off upsets in Arizona, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, all seats currently held by Democrats and an independent who caucuses with the Democratic Party. Those three races all lean in Democrats’ favor, according to the polls. In Arizona, Democrat Ruben Gallego leads Republican Kari Lake by 6.4 points, according to the RCP average. The average of polls also gives Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen a 5.5-point lead in Nevada over Republican Sam Brown, and Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) has a 3.8-point lead over Republican Dave McCormick in the Keystone State.",right
42,https://www.dailywire.com/news/nate-silver-publishes-two-dozen-reasons-why-trump-could-defeat-kamala,Nate Silver Publishes Two Dozen Reasons Why Trump Could Defeat Kamala,"A well-known statistician, Nate Silver, shared on Sunday two dozen reasons why he believes former President Donald Trump could defeat Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In a post to his online newsletter, the “Silver Bulletin,” Silver explained how he wanted to provide a “laundry list” of factors that favor Trump to counter the notion that this year’s White House race is Harris’ to lose.

The list was published less than three weeks out from Election Day as betting markets, polls, and Silver Bulletin’s own forecast show Trump gaining momentum and leading Harris in key battleground states.

Silver said Harris is favored to win the popular vote, but he stressed Republicans are favored by a 2-point Electoral College “bias” that is “inherently difficult for Democrats to overcome” in close elections.

Other reasons focused on the economy, including high inflation, voter “perceptions” that lag “objective data,” and “nostalgia” for the “relatively strong” economy under Trump before the COVID pandemic hit.

Silver noted that incumbent parties are doing “very poorly” worldwide, populism is “often a highly effective strategy,” and illegal immigration “increased substantially” in recent years as backlash to it grew.

He said Harris lacks a “viable strategy” for explaining her changing stances and has to contend with a late start to her run as well as taking in some of the staff from President Joe Biden’s “poorly-run” campaign.

Taking a look at a broader scale in the U.S., Silver declared that “cultural vibes are shifting to the right” while the Left “continues to pay a price for the excesses of 2020 on COVID, crime, ‘wokeness,’ and other issues.”

MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28

More of Silver’s reasons included Democrats losing support among black voters and other minority groups as well as “many men, especially younger men,” feeling “lost” amid a number of societal shifts.

Silver said voter “objections” related to Biden’s advanced age before he dropped out of the 2024 race ultimately “neuters what should have been one of Harris’s best issues about Trump’s age and cognitive fitness.”

Harris, seeking to become the first woman president, was also mentioned as a reason why Trump might win, as Silver explained that in the 2016 election, “undecideds broke heavily against Hillary Clinton, and she underperformed her polls.”

Silver listed low trust in the media, Trump’s effectiveness at “convincing voters that he’s on their side even if his election would not be in their best interest,” and the Democrats focusing so much on January 6.

There is also the Democrats’ “college-educated consultant class” having “poor instincts” for appealing to the mass public while Trump has “done more to cultivate support among ‘weird’ marginal voting groups.”

Further reasons included how the world has become “more unstable” under Biden, the Israel-Hamas war fracturing the Democratic base, and Harris running on “vibes” while struggling to “articulate” her vision.

Silver also listed more Left-leaning third-party candidates than Right-leaning ones, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. endorsing Trump, Elon Musk backing Trump, and Trump surviving two assassination attempts.",right
43,https://www.dailywire.com/news/cnn-data-analyst-shreds-trump-voter-regret-narrative-only-2-would-switch-votes,CNN Data Analyst Shreds ‘Trump Voter Regret’ Narrative: Only 2% Would Switch Votes,"CNN Chief Data Analyst Harry Enten poured cold water on the mainstream media narrative that Trump voters “regret” their decision, revealing a new poll showing just 2% of the president’s 2024 voters would “vote differently” if given the chance.

Enten’s remarks came during a segment on “CNN News Central,” where he presented findings from a University of Massachusetts Amherst/YouGov poll published Monday

“I hear all these stories, all these articles, ‘All the Trump voters, they regret what they did back in 2024.’ I’m here to tell you, ‘Uh uh.’ Very few of them regret what they did back in 2024,” Enten explained during his segment.

He emphasized the minimal regret among Trump supporters, saying, “What percentage would change their vote to a different candidate? We’re talking just 2%. Just 2%. That’s not even a wide spot on the road,” with the numbers being “rather similar” for Harris.

The data analyst estimated that, based on this poll, if the 2024 election were held again, Trump would likely still defeat former Vice President Kamala Harris.

🚨NEW: CNN's Harry Enten DUMPS cold water on narrative that Trump voters ""regret"" backing him🚨 ""I hear all these stories, all these articles, 'All the Trump voters, they regret what they did back in 2024.' I'm here to tell you, 'Uh uh.' Very few of them regret what they did… pic.twitter.com/0IPvrpk0VS — Jason Cohen 🇺🇸 (@JasonJournoDC) April 16, 2025

“So if there was a repeat, if folks got to be able to redo their vote that they had back in 2024, would the result be any different? I doubt it would be. I doubt it would be, or it would still be extremely close. The bottom line is for all this talk of Trump voters regretting their vote, in the numbers, it really just doesn’t show up,” Enten said.

Enten also mentioned this pattern is not unique to the 2024 election, as Trump voters similarly showed minimal regret following their choice in 2016.

“So the bottom line is this: If there’s some idea out there that Trump voters are going around, ‘Man, I wish I had voted for Kamala Harris instead of Donald Trump,’ the numbers say that is a fanciful universe,” he added. “It really, for the most part, does not exist.”

Since Trump’s inauguration, the mainstream media have incessantly spotlighted estranged Trump voters who allegedly had second thoughts about backing Trump following his executive actions on immigration and federal bureaucracy cuts, all of which were frequent talking points on the campaign trail.

The president’s approval rating currently stands at approximately 47% overall, according to RealClearPolitics polling averages.

This marks a significant improvement from his first term, when ratings hovered in the low 40s throughout most of his tenure, further reinforcing Enten’s analysis of the YouGov poll’s findings that his base remains firmly supportive despite contrary media narratives.",right
44,https://www.dailywire.com/news/journalist-claims-obama-was-working-against-kamala-harris-being-2024-nominee,Journalist Claims Obama Was ‘Working Against’ Kamala Harris Being 2024 Nominee,"According to the co-author of the new book “FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,” former President Obama did not want former Vice-President Kamala Harris to be the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee and worked against the possibility.

Journalist Jonathan Allen, who currently works for NBC News, has co-authored “HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton,” “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign,” and “Lucky: How Joe Biden Barely Won The Presidency.” He appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Tuesday.

“President Obama absolutely did not think that Joe Biden should continue, according to our sources close to President Obama,” Allen stated, as Mediaite reported. “And he also didn’t want Kamala Harris to be the replacement for Biden. He didn’t think that she was the best choice for Democrats. And he worked really behind the scenes for a long time to try to have a mini-primary or an open convention or mini-primary leading to an open convention, did not have faith in her ability to win the election. So and as it turned out, she didn’t win, but he was really working against her.”

“In one moment, he had set up a phone call with Congressman [Jim] Clyburn from South Carolina on the day that Joe Biden handed off the baton to Kamala Harris,” he continued. “And Obama had set up a call with Clyburn for like 5:30 that afternoon. And Clyburn thought to himself, ‘This guy is going to try to rope me into the open convention thing. I better get my endorsement of Harris out there fast so that this is a short conversation.’ And when Harris talked to Obama on the day that Biden handed off to her, Obama was unwilling to give his endorsement then.”

In the book, Allen writes, “In private conversations, Obama flat-out told allies she would lose to Trump … ‘He did not think she should be the candidate,’ said one confidant. He liked the idea of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer at the top of the ticket and Maryland Governor Wes Moore at the bottom. … he didn’t want a coronation of Harris.”

Allen told Fox News that Obama said to Harris when Biden dropped out, “I don’t want to put my thumb on the scale.”

“She was disappointed but not necessarily shocked because he’d been behind the scenes trying to undermine her for the last several weeks before Biden even got out,” Allen added.",right

In a nearly ten-minute long video posted on Tuesday on TikTok, the 62-year-old TV personality/comedian and vocal supporter of the Democratic Party said on January 15, before Trump was sworn in as the 47th President of the United States, she and her 12-year-old daughter Dakota — who now goes by Clay — moved to Ireland.

“It’s been pretty wonderful, I have to say. The people are so loving and so kind, so welcoming and I’m very grateful,” O’Donnell said, noting that she decided to move because it “would be the best for myself and my 12-year-old child.”

“I’m happy. Clay is happy,” she added. “I miss my other kids. I miss my friends. I miss many things about life there at home and I’m trying to find a home here in this beautiful country and when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that’s when we will consider coming back.”

“It’s been heartbreaking to see what’s happening politically and hard for me personally as well. The personal is political, as we all know,” O’Donnell continued, subtly referencing her past battles with Trump.

Without naming Trump, the former host of “The View” said the move out of the United States was something she just felt like she and her child “needed to take care of ourselves and make some hard decisions and follow through.”

O’Donnell said that the legacy media in America “has been letting us all down” and “haven’t been doing their job,” which she said they are required to do “in order to maintain a democracy.” The comedian also claimed the only place a person can get news about “protests and what not” was on TikTok, without explaining further.

“So, here’s hoping that they [media] will get better before it’s too late,” O’Donnell said. “And here’s hoping that it’s not too late already. Protect your sanity is all I can say. Protect your sanity as much as you can, and try not to swim in the chaos if possible. But I know it’s nearly impossible when you’re there in the middle of it.”

“I think about everyone every day and the United States of America,” she added. “And I am hoping that we can turn things around, counting on you, all of you, to do what’s right. And I think deep down inside, we all know what that is.”

O’Donnell has five children through adoption since 1995: Parker, 29, Chelsea, 27, Blake, 25, Vivienne, 22, and Dakota, 12, Hello! magazine noted.",right

The RNC put out a statement calling Trump the winner of the primary shortly after former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley suspended her presidential campaign on Wednesday morning. Haley bowed out after a string of Super Tuesday losses that saw Trump make big gains in the delegate count ahead of the Republican convention.

“Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump on his huge primary victory! I’d also like to congratulate Nikki Haley for running a hard-fought campaign and becoming the first woman to win a Republican presidential primary contest,” RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.

“President Trump once delivered a booming economy, secure border, energy independence, and America’s strength on the world stage, the exact opposite of the chaos created by Joe Biden,” she added. “Republican voters have spoken loud and clear with historically large margins and we are more united than ever to beat Biden and Democrats up and down the ballot in November.”

McDaniel has headed the RNC since 2017 and enjoyed support from Trump in that position until recently. Under pressure from the former president, the chairwoman announced last week that she plans to step down this month. She is expected to leave her post on Friday, March 8.

McDaniel elicited anger from other members of her party when, in January, she urged Republicans to “unite” around Trump while other contenders were still vying for the GOP nomination.

Trump’s sweep of Super Tuesday states broke in Vermont, where Haley won the contest by roughly 4 points. It was Haley’s second primary victory of the cycle after she won in Washington, D.C., over the weekend.

Haley declined to speak after her lone Super Tuesday victory. Instead, her campaign released a statement touting Haley’s victory as a woman and warning of a “large block of Republican primary voters who are expressing deep concerns about Donald Trump.” Haley appeared on Wednesday morning to officially suspend her campaign. She did not endorse Trump.

Trump put out a statement on his social media platform, Truth Social, claiming victory over Haley on Super Tuesday and inviting her supporters to back him.

“Nikki Haley got TROUNCED last night, in record setting fashion, despite the fact that Democrats, for reasons unknown, are allowed to vote in Vermont, and various other Republican Primaries,” Trump said.

“I’d like to thank my family, friends, and the Great Republican Party for helping me to produce, by far, the most successful Super Tuesday in HISTORY, and would further like to invite all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our Nation.

Sources close to Haley told multiple outlets that she would drop out of the race after just winning one of 15 contests on Tuesday. Haley was the last major challenger to Trump and has been critical of him throughout her campaign. She managed to defeat him in Vermont, but lost by wide margins in the other states that voted.

“Today, in state after state, there remains a large block of Republican primary voters who are expressing deep concerns about Donald Trump,” spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas said on Tuesday. “That is not the unity our party needs for success.”

During her campaign, Haley picked up wins in the District of Columbia and Vermont, but failed to build momentum in other states, taking third in Iowa and losing by over ten points in New Hampshire after the rest of the field had dropped out. Last month, she was unable to win in her home state of South Carolina, where she is expected to announce the suspension of her campaign.

The Koch network’s Americans for Prosperity dropped funding for Haley after her fourth primary loss.

While initially promising to back the Republican party’s nominee last year, she has recently been hesitant to confirm whether she plans on endorsing Trump if he takes the nomination. Sources told the Wall Street Journal that she will not make an endorsement on Wednesday.

“What I will tell you is that I have serious concerns about Donald Trump. I have more serious concerns about Joe Biden,” she said in February.

During the Trump administration, Haley was his ambassador to the United Nations for several years. She has since been critical of him and claimed that he will be unable to beat President Joe Biden in November. She also has been vocal about Trump’s legal battles as he faces dozens of charges in multiple states.

“This may be his survival mode to pay his legal fees and get out of some sort of legal peril, but this is like suicide for our country,” she said. “We’ve got to realize that if we don’t have someone who can win a general election, all we are doing is caving to the socialist left.”

Analyzing the numbers to Trump's win

After polls closed on Election Day in states across the country, data is coming in with the results of the 2024 election. The presidential race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris went to Trump in the early morning hours, after he was projected to win several key battleground states where pre-election polling had showed them locked in a virtual tie.

51,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dnc-chair-race-2024-election-losses/,Democrats suffered devastating losses in 2024 elections. The race to take over the party has begun.,"Two candidates have officially launched their campaign to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee, kicking off the race to determine who will lead the party's recovery after widespread losses in 2024.

Martin O'Malley, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate and former Maryland Governor, became the first notable figure to jump into the race on Monday. Ken Martin, who is the chair of Minnesota's arm of the Democratic party, and a DNC vice chair, announced his campaign Tuesday morning.

Democrats are sifting through the fallout of the 2024 presidential election, where they not only lost the White House and control of the Senate but also failed to win back control of the House. The party finds itself without a clear leader and unified vision for the future, representing both a hurdle for the next DNC chair but also an opportunity to overhaul Democrats' approach with voters across the country in the coming years.

Whoever the party's over 440 members elect to lead the party's national committee will be in charge of the party's top-level infrastructure, organizing and fundraising. And while DNC members tell CBS News that the eventual chair won't determine the widespread policy of the party, that person will serve as a notable mouthpiece to help craft the Democratic message.

While the party itself was locked out of federal control after the elections, fundraising remained strong. As a candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris raked in over $1 billion within the few months she was in the race. Her sum includes money raised by the DNC.

Jamie Harrison, the current DNC chair, has said he would not seek reelection.

The timeline for the election is not yet determined, though it will be addressed in a DNC Rules & Bylaws committee meeting on Dec. 12. DNC members expect the election itself to take place at their widespread member meeting before early spring 2025.

In their launches, O'Malley and Martin both said prioritizing the party's message on the economy is essential. The state of the economy was a big issue that bolstered President-elect Donald Trump's return to office, according to a CBS News exit poll.

""When I'm traveling around the country, most people I chat with want the same things: to stay ahead on their bills, to give their families a better life and to live in safe and healthy communities. That's exactly what Democrats stand for, but we need to reconnect our ideas,"" Martin said in his campaign video.

Chuck Rocha, a political strategist who worked for Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign and Sen-elect Ruben Gallego's campaign, told CBS News he is ""seriously considering"" a run for chair and has fielded calls from a handful of DNC members and nonprofits.

Rocha said he's still waiting to see how the field develops before jumping in, and ""if there's a better candidate that really stands for what I want to see done with the party.""

But Rocha has set several action items he would take as chair: eliminate education requirements for senior DNC positions, mandating that state parties ""be more inclusive"" and diverse with consultant hiring, and to focus on building party infrastructure in all 50 states.

Asked about Martin's and O'Malley's campaigns, Rocha called them ""names that are from the institution.""

""I think we need somebody from the outside and a strategist to come in and rebuild the party,"" said Rocha, who noted that his non-college background and upbringing in East Texas could be an advantage as the party looks to reconnect with working-class voters.

Other names that could potentially run include Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, who is ""seriously considering"" a run for chair according to a source familiar with his thinking.

Rahm Emanuel, the current U.S. ambassador to Japan and former Chicago Mayor, is also mulling over a run according to Axios. But potentially choosing Emanuel, a polarizing figure in the Democratic party, has been panned by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and progressive groups.

Martin, a DNC member since he became a state party chair in 2011, may be the early favorite. Alan Clendenin, an executive DNC board member who is already supporting Martin, said he has ""a lot of friends in the DNC"" and pointed to relationships built from his time as President of the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC). Clendenin said Martin already has support from just under 100 DNC committee members.

""The party is in a place where we have to have someone who has a really solid understanding of existing party infrastructure. What's there, what's not there. People who have walked the walk. Talked the talk. People who have had to deal with the frustration of what's lacking and be able to understand what it takes to turn things around,"" Clendenin said about Martin and the chair position.

Democrats' lack of success in 2024 could linger over any of the candidates in the race. While Minnesota has been a reliably blue state under Martin's watch, it's not seen as a presidential battleground state. But if Democrats wanted to gravitate towards someone from any of the seven presidential battlegrounds, the fact that the Harris-Walz ticket lost every one of them may prove to be a hindrance for a party incredibly eager to avoid a repeat performance in 2028.

""We just need to win,"" said one DNC member about the stakes of the chair race. ""We need to know who's coming with the game plan to make it happen… We don't make policy. We win elections, and we win presidential elections. That's our priority.""",left
52,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-conspiracies-persist-even-with-different-outcomes-2024-election/,"Analysis: Election conspiracies persist, even with different outcomes in the 2024 election","We just had another election with a clear and verifiable victor, overseen by hundreds of thousands of election officials. Those public servants have suffered years of harassment, and despite their successes, are still being accused of taking part in a massive and impossible conspiracy — a conspiracy led by the party out of power to steal an election and cover up all evidence.

Despite all evidence, many still believe that the opposition Democrats secretly overwhelmed the power of the Trump administration in 2020 to steal an election by 7 million popular votes and 70 electoral votes. And they believe that the Biden administration suddenly lost this mythical election-stealing power while controlling the executive branch in 2024.

Within hours of President-elect Donald Trump's projected victory in the 2024 election, conspiracy theories began to spread among those who opposed him. On the left, there were claims that ""the math just didn't add up,"" that 20 million ballots were ""missing"" or that Elon Musk's Starlink was uploading fake votes to help Trump. There was mischaracterization about why voters might split their votes between Trump and a Democrat.

On the right, from those who supported Trump came claims that the ""20 million missing ballots"" were actually proof that the 2020 election had been stolen and that there was no possible way that President Biden could have received 81 million votes that year.

For those who work in elections, and particularly the election officials around the country — public servants of both parties — these claims are familiar, and exhausting. And to be clear, these claims are false on their face.

Millions of ballots weren't missing – they were being counted, and when the election is officially certified, we will confirm that the 2024 election saw only slightly lower turnout than 2020's all-time record. For those questioning ""missing votes,"" the 2024 election will end up seeing the second-largest number of ballots cast in any American election, and the second-highest turnout in any election in over 100 years, behind only 2020's record turnout.

As for split votes, that happens all the time. Sometimes, as in 2020, there are a large number of voters who dislike both presidential candidates and choose to leave that race blank on their ballots. Sometimes, as in 2024, a significant number of people vote only for president, and leave the rest of their ballots blank. This is normal. Republicans in Arizona, Nevada, and Wisconsin didn't game the system to give Trump a win this year while allowing Democratic senators to win in each of those states. Democrats in 2020 didn't rig the system to defeat Trump that year, only to then give up key seats in state legislatures right before redistricting that would decide control of Congress. And we have the paper ballots that confirm this.

And those paper ballots are the key. Trump won in 2024 in a verified, confirmed election with over 95% paper ballots, including all the ballots in all the swing states. Hand audits of those ballots are nearly complete and will confirm the results.

Similarly, Mr. Biden won in 2020 in a verified, confirmed election with over 95% audited paper ballots, including all the ballots in all the swing states. The math adds up because the ballots add up, and the election officials have shown their work.

We know who won the last two presidential elections, thanks to the paper ballots, audits, and more election litigation and court review than any election in world history. In dozens of court cases, losing candidates couldn't produce a single piece of evidence that raised any question about the 2020 election outcome.

When Rudy Giuliani and Kari Lake were sued for defamation about their false claims, they could have defended themselves with evidence that they were speaking the truth. Instead, they conceded liability (Giuliani's assets have begun to be seized, and Lake just settled her case this past weekend). Fox News settled its defamation case with Dominion Voting Systems for nearly $800 million, rather than attempt to present evidence of the truth of its claims. A group of esteemed conservative legal scholars further confirmed the 2020 election was ""Lost, not Stolen.""

But whether coming from the right or the left, the conspiracies continue, and our nation's election officials are concerned about the lasting damage. Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer of the Georgia Secretary of State's office told me, ""Ideas that Musk's Starlink or black box voting might change votes plant seeds that will germinate into deeper conspiracy theories, and then further undermine faith in elections and institutions.""

Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates confirmed, ""People who push conspiracy theories without basis that tabulation machines have been breached or that dead people have voted by the thousands do harm to our democracy, regardless of whether the allegations come from the right, left or the middle of the political spectrum.""

Our elections are incredibly decentralized, with nearly 10,000 different election jurisdictions nationwide, varying in technologies and processes. Our process is run by hundreds of thousands of election officials nationwide, of both parties. Every voter registration requires ID under federal law, and our voter records are as accurate as ever. In the exceedingly rare cases where fraud is attempted, it is caught and prosecuted. It is effectively impossible to steal a major election in the United States.

But foreign adversaries and domestic grifters understand how to exploit concerns about the security of American elections. They have employed a more effective strategy, to convince us against all evidence that our elections are being stolen. They have become masters at leveraging the losing side's disappointment at the outcome to create a fantasy world of election denial and to stoke fear, anger and hate directed at our fellow citizens, including our public servants. We saw on Jan. 6, 2021, how this anger can lead to violence.

Entertaining these delusions could threaten our agency as voters. Worse, our susceptibility to these false claims aids U.S. adversaries, and puts public servants at risk. If we become a nation where both parties can only accept the integrity of our election system when they win, we are truly lost as a democracy.

Note: Exit poll percentages may have updated since this post.

The voters in the 2024 presidential election were looking for a leader and someone who could bring needed change, and for that change they looked back to former President Donald Trump.

He was propelled by an electorate dissatisfied with the state of the country, the economy and by the many voters who were feeling the impact of inflation.

Vice President Kamala Harris underperformed with key parts of the Democratic coalition, while Trump made some inroads. He also continued to excel with some groups who have historically backed him, keeping his coalition largely intact.

The ability to lead and to be someone who can bring needed change were the top two candidate qualities for voters — and Trump won them handily.

Two thirds of voters described the economy as bad, and those voters who did went big for Trump.

And on a personal level, more said they were worse off financially compared to four years ago — and 8 in 10 of those voters backed Trump.

Most said inflation was a hardship, including nearly a quarter who said the hardship was severe.

On issues, the state of democracy and the economy were the top concerns for voters. And while most voters said they wanted abortion to be legal, the issue did not rise to the top for voters.

Harris led Trump among those who said abortion should be legal, but Trump did capture 28% of those voters, indicating these voters' position on the issue was not as salient when it came to their vote choice.

Voter groups



Harris lost some support among some traditional Democratic coalition groups, while Trump held much of his coalition together.

Trump also targeted marginal voters in his campaign and nationally, the voters who did not vote in the 2020 presidential election voted for him over Harris.

Trump made inroads with some parts of the Democratic coalition, including young voters, and particularly young men under age 30.

In particular, in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — states where Mr. Biden won voters age 18-29 by double digits —Harris' margins were far smaller.

In Pennsylvania, Trump did well with younger men, a group Mr. Biden won in this state by 9 points. Much of Harris' less than robust performance with voters 18-29 was due to the fact that Trump performed better with younger men than he did in 2020.

Trump made gains with Latino voters both nationally and in some key battleground states. And nationally, more Latino men backed Trump over Harris, a reversal from four years ago when that group backed Mr. Biden. For Latino men, the economy was their top issue, and most said they were worse off financially compared to four years ago.

Harris won a majority of Black voters, but she didn't do as well as Biden, particularly in some states with Black men. Trump got the support of about 1 in 5 Black men in North Carolina, more than doubling his support from 2020.

Independents swung more toward Trump. They backed him in Georgia, for example, where they went for Mr. Biden by 9 points.

Nationally, more voters thought Trump's views were extreme than said that of Harris, but roughly 1 in 10 those voters backed him anyway.

The CBS News exit poll interviewed thousands of voters across the country at more than 200 polling locations on Election Day and in the weeks leading up to Election Day in order to capture those who cast a ballot early.

False: Social media posts claim Harris voters bused from New York to Pennsylvania

Social media users are claiming Kamala Harris voters from New York City are being bused to vote in Pennsylvania.

Details: Many of the claims reviewed by CBS News included a video posted Tuesday by Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, which depicts a line of people standing next to several buses in Manhattan. Those volunteers weren't being bused to vote in Pennsylvania, but rather, were taking part in a canvassing event organized by the Democratic National Committee, Levine's office confirmed.

""The idea that campaign volunteers from New York knocking on doors in Pennsylvania are actually part of a secret conspiracy of fake voters is so absurd it doesn't really warrant a response,"" Levine said in a statement to CBS News.

One of the posts reviewed by CBS News had been viewed more than 2 million times, with thousands of replies and reposts amplifying its message. That post also claimed that 150 people were detained in connection with the incident. A spokesperson for the New York City Police Department said they had no record of any such incident.

False: Elon Musk claimed Google intentionally manipulating search results in favor of Harris

Social media platform X owner Elon Musk posted, then deleted, a screen recording comparing the Google searches. The post reached over 2.5 million views before its removal, with other posts garnering thousands of views.

Details: Google said searches for ""where to vote for Harris"" yielded a polling location map because Harris is also the name of a county in Texas, not because of bias for the Democratic candidate.

Searching for ""where to vote for Trump"" returned news articles and standard search results, while ""where to vote for Vance"" produced a similar polling locations map because Vance is the name of a county in North Carolina.

Google adjusted its algorithm Tuesday to prevent candidate-related queries from returning polling maps. Google trends data show that searching ""where to vote"" is a much more common query than searching where to vote for either Trump or Harris.

False: Social media posts claim Milwaukee mayor, a Democrat, said the city's votes would not be counted on election night

On X, users claimed that the Democratic mayor of Milwaukee said at a news conference that Milwaukee would not be counting ballots tonight.

Details: Votes in Milwaukee will be tabulated tonight despite posts on the social media platform X that have pushed a false claim that Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said votes in the city won't be counted on election night.

In reality, vote counting started Tuesday morning and will continue late into Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning at the city's so-called ""central count"" location, according to Johnson's communications director, Jeff Fleming.

""They've already started tabulating, and had tabulated thousands of ballots by this afternoon,"" Fleming said. ""The vote totals exceeded our original projections, so the workload at central count is higher than expected.""

Milwaukee's votes can take longer to count for several reasons, Barry Burden, Director of the University of Wisconsin's Elections Research Center, said.

""It's the biggest city, and it has the most ballots, and it also counts absentee ballots at a central location,"" Burden said. ""That'll be after midnight, 1 (a.m.) or 2 a.m.""

The city's more than 200 election workers started counting votes at 9 a.m. Tuesday morning, Fleming said. They'll continue the tabulation overnight, and ballots will be delivered to county clerks either the next day or the day after, depending on local rules.

Spreadsheet error corrected: GOP U.S. House candidate says Harris County, Texas, early vote results showed big drops and spikes in early voting

U.S. House candidate Caroline Kane, a Republican running in Texas' 7th District, posted on X Monday that Harris County's early vote results showed significant drops and spikes in the number of early voters for several voting locations between Sunday and Monday, which should not be possible.

Details: Election officials said a misaligned spreadsheet caused the publicly reported early vote totals in Harris County to appear incorrectly. Local officials have corrected the document posted online by Kane. They noted the spreadsheet was labeled ""unofficial"" and said the error would not impact the official vote tally.

In a statement, the Office of the Harris County Clerk said, ""In the process of updating the daily record of early vote totals for two vote centers (Baytown Community Center and Mission Bend Center), the formatting of the spreadsheet inadvertently misaligned, causing cells to shift and reflect incorrect numbers for other locations. Our office is aware and is actively working to correct the report.""

""I assure you that every vote that was cast will be accurately tallied,"" the statement from the clerk's office concluded.

Voters are using paper ballots as technicians review the issue.

""All votes will be counted and we continue to encourage everyone to vote,"" the county commissioner's office said in a press release.

According to the county's petition to extend voting hours, the malfunction ""caused voter confusion, long lines of voters, and many individuals left the polling locations without casting a ballot.

""The Pennsylvania Department of State said it is in contact with Cambria County and is ""committed to ensuring a free, fair, safe, and secure election.""

False: Social media post claims over 14,000 power outages in Northampton County, Pennsylvania

One widely shared social media post claimed there were over 14,000 power outages at around 1 p.m. ET. in Northampton County.

Details: Voting was not impacted by power outages in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, according to a county spokesperson and spokesperson for Met-Ed, an electricity provider in the state. The county is north of Philadelphia.

A power outage just before noon on Tuesday that lasted 6 - 10 minutes affected eight polling stations in Northampton County, the Met-Ed spokesperson said, but voting was not disrupted because the sites had battery backups.

Social media users posted about outages in parts of Eastern Pennsylvania, blaming the outages for long lines and delays in voting. Met-Ed's spokesperson said this was false and that there was only one outage impacting about 17,000 customers at 11:42 a.m.

Wisconsin officials hit reset after gaffe with tabulation machine doors, saying no threat to votes but modest delay

Details: The tabulating machines at Milwaukee Central Count are being reset, and officials will start a re-count of some 31,000 ballots. This means the final count will be delayed.

There is no estimate as to how long the delay will be. Officials said the doors of the machines weren't closed properly and did not seal. They said for the sake of transparency, the approximately 31,000 ballots will be put through the counting machines again.

Officials emphasized that there was no evidence of any actual risk to the ballots or vote count. The machines were being zeroed out under observation before beginning the count again. Milwaukee's GOP Chair, Hilario Deleon, told CBS News that he and Milwaukee Elections Commission Executive Director Paulian Gutierrez went around to all the tabulation machines to check them together and closed the doors.

At the time, Deleon told me he felt good about the transparency in the process and that it had been resolved. He noted that he had alerted his party's attorneys.

Pennsylvania officials say ""bad-faith mass challenges"" target more than 3,500 voters

Details: If the election in Pennsylvania is close, new challenges made to over 3,500 voters, many of whom live overseas and cast ballots by mail, could prove to be a pivotal part of the effort to undermine confidence in the 2024 election.

""Throughout the day Friday, several bad-faith mass challenges were filed in a coordinated effort in counties across the Commonwealth to question the qualifications of thousands of registered Pennsylvania voters who applied to vote by mail ballot,"" the Pennsylvania Department of State said in a statement.

Most of the voters are individuals who live overseas and vote absentee under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, a federal law that has allowed certain citizens living overseas to vote since 1986. This group of voters includes active military members, people who work abroad, and expats.

False: Trump claims ""massive cheating"" in Philadelphia

Trump claimed in a Truth Social post that ""massive cheating"" is happening in Philadelphia today.

Details: Trump's claim that ""massive cheating"" is happening in Philadelphia on Election Day is false, City Commissioner Seth Bluestein, a Republican, said.

""There is absolutely no truth to this allegation,"" Bluestein wrote on X, adding that voting in Philadelphia has been safe and secure.

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said that there's no ""factual basis"" to Trump's claim. ""The only talk about massive cheating has come from one of the candidates, Donald J. Trump,"" Krasner said in a statement. ""There is no factual basis whatsoever within law enforcement to support this wild allegation. We have invited complaints and allegations of improprieties all day. If Donald J. Trump has any facts to support his wild allegations, we want them now. Right now. We are not holding our breath.""

The Philadelphia Police Department said it wasn't ""aware of anything"" Trump referred to in his post. A senior federal official also suggested Trump's posts about cheating in Philadelphia and law enforcement activity in Philadelphia and Detroit were not true: ""We have seen no evidence, data or reporting to support these claims.""

X suspends three accounts that shared Russian disinformation

The social media platform X suspended multiple accounts on Tuesday that recently shared fabricated videos likely created by Russian influence groups.

The videos included fabricated FBI statements, false claims about Haitians voting illegally in Georgia, and election workers ripping up ballots in Pennsylvania.

One of the accounts shared a new fabricated video about Wisconsin before the account was suspended, according to Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub. The video purported to show two people, one wearing a Harris hoodie, attacking a Trump supporter wearing a MAGA hat at a polling center.

No such incident has been reported, and Wisconsin does not allow people to wear political clothing to polling stations, according to the state's Elections Commission. Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe said the video is not legitimate and does not show a Wisconsin polling center.

Linvill said a Russian influence group known as Storm-1516 was likely behind the videos and the accounts were likely part of their distribution network.

X also suspended a number of accounts that shared fabricated videos claiming to be from the FBI that promoted false claims about voter fraud and threats to polling places. The fabricated FBI videos were likely created by a separate Russian influence group, researchers say.

X did not confirm why it suspended the accounts. When asked about the footage allegedly showing Wisconsin, X's press office told CBS News the account had been suspended.

There have been dozens of bomb threats across at least five states, but authorities say they're not credible

There have been dozens of bomb threats in states including Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, but federal and local law enforcement authorities have said they were not credible.

While a comprehensive count is not yet available, CBS is tracking 33 reported incidents and has confirmed the addresses of 22 threats through statements by elections, courts and law enforcement officials.

At this time, CBS News has confirmed that at least 21 of these threats were on active voting precincts.

President-elect Donald Trump is the projected winner of the 2024 election, claiming victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for the White House.

As of Saturday evening, with a final win in Arizona, Trump was projected to win 312 electoral votes, 42 more than the 270 needed to clinch victory.

The president-elect has won all seven battleground states, according to CBS News projections. The seven states considered battlegrounds this year were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. President Biden won six of them in 2020 — all but North Carolina.

Here's a look at the states Trump lost in 2020 but won in 2024:

Georgia

CBS News projected Trump would win Georgia on election night. Votes are still being counted in Georgia, but with 99% of jurisdictions reporting, he's leading by about 2 percentage points.

Trump's reclaiming of Georgia comes four years after he lost to Mr. Biden there by fewer than 12,000 votes, which prompted a failed attempt to pressure state officials to ""find"" the votes he'd need to win.

Michigan

Michigan, after going for Mr. Biden in 2020, slipped back into Trump's win column this year. With 99% of jurisdictions reporting results, as of 1 p.m. ET, Wednesday, Trump was leading by a margin of 1.5 percentage points, or roughly 83,000 votes.

Mr. Biden secured Michigan four years ago by just over 150,000 votes.

Pennsylvania

Trump won the crucial battleground of Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes with a 2.3-point margin, or just over 150,000 votes as of Wednesday afternoon. Votes are still being counted.

In 2020, Mr. Biden defeated Trump in the Keystone State by 181,000 votes.

Wisconsin

Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes returned to Trump this election. With 99% of the vote in, Trump led Harris in the state by just 1 percentage point, or almost 30,000 votes, as of 12 p.m. ET on Wednesday.

In 2016, Trump ended Democrats' decades-long winning streak in Wisconsin when he defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In previous years, Democrats won the state in every presidential election since 1988.

However, Mr. Biden prevailed in Wisconsin 2020 by less than 1 point.

Nevada

CBS News projected late Thursday night that Trump had won Nevada and its six electoral votes. Mr. Biden won Nevada in 2020 by over 30,000 votes. The state had not gone for a Republican since 2004.

Arizona

CBS News projected Saturday night that Trump had won Arizona and its 11 electoral votes.

In 2020, Mr. Biden edged out Trump in Arizona by 0.3 points, a razor-thin margin of 10,457 votes. This marked only the second time Arizona voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1948, putting all eyes on the Grand Canyon State as a battleground in the 2024 election.

57,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-platform-policy-positions-2024/,Trump's policy plans and platform on key issues for the 2024 election,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris face off today in a historic election following a tumultuous 2024 presidential campaign. The two candidates only debated once, on Sept. 10, giving Americans the chance to hear what they have to say about some of the most pressing issues facing the country, including the economy, immigration, abortion access, foreign affairs and more.

Trump has criticized Democrats' handing of the economy and has shared his positions on what should be done about an array of issues, including taxes, inflation and immigration. Here are some key points from the plans he's offered, information about his record and what he's said about some of these subjects. (A similar overview of Harris' positions can be found here.)

Taxes

Trump and Harris have competing tax plans. Both nominees' plans would have to be passed by Congress, which has the power of the purse. Here's what Trump has proposed so far:

Trump says he would extend tax cuts enacted in 2017, which reduced taxes for most Americans, though research has shown that top earners benefited the most.

Trump's plan would result in tax cuts for all, but the results for Americans vastly differ from Harris' proposal, according to an analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Under Trump, everyone would receive a tax cut, but the lowest earners — those making under $19,600 — would just see a $320 difference in take-home pay, while under Harris, that same income group would have another $2,355 after taxes. The very highest earners under Trump would receive a tax break of $376,910, according to the Penn Wharton analysis.



Both Trump and Harris want to eliminate federal taxes on tips, something Trump proposed and Harris echoed.

Trump is also promising to end income taxes on Social Security benefits, which would help middle- and upper-middle income seniors the most.

Inflation

Child tax credit

Abortion



Trump and Harris have opposing views on abortion access, an issue that could be a crucial motivator for voters in November.

Both Trump and Harris have highlighted the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade

Trump has said the issue should be left up to the voters of each state, declaring in an April video that ""the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land.""

While Trump has stopped short of backing a federal abortion ban, he said during a March radio interview that ""people are agreeing on 15, and I'm thinking in terms of that."" During his presidential debate with Harris, however, Trump declared, ""I'm not signing a ban."" He did not offer a direct response when asked whether he'd veto a national abortion ban if it were passed by Congress. ""I won't have to,"" he said. But when asked for a ""yes or no"" because running mate Sen. JD Vance ""has said that you would veto,"" Trump responded, ""I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness.""

But Trump has also called a six-week ban on the November ballot

Trump backtracked after facing swift backlash from conservatives and said he would be voting ""no""

IVF

Access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) services became a campaign issue after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos created during the IVF process could be considered children. The decision threatened the availability of IVF services in Alabama and thrust access to fertility treatments into the national conversation, including among the presidential candidates.

Trump unveiled a new plan

Immigration

Trump has promised to launch the largest deportation operation in American history, invoking the notorious ""Operation Wetback"" roundup of Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans in the 1950s under President Dwight Eisenhower. Officials question whether the promise is feasible given the significant operational and legal constraints involved in deporting millions of unauthorized immigrants, some of whom have U.S. citizen children.

Trump vowed to try to end birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants living in the country illegally — a move that legal experts say is unlikely to pass constitutional muster.

The former president says he plans to reinstate his hardline border policies, including a program requiring migrants to remain in Mexico while their asylum cases are reviewed. He has also pledged to militarize the U.S.-Mexico border and to deputize the National Guard to arrest migrants crossing into the country unlawfully.

Trump has not ruled out reviving the practice of separating migrant parents from their children as a way to deter migration, a policy that was discontinued after public outcry and a judicial order.

He has talked about denying entry to legal immigrants based on their ideological beliefs, saying the move would target ""Marxists"" and ""communists.""

Trump says he'd suspend refugee admissions from the Middle East, and suggested he would reinstate and expand the travel ban his administration issued for certain countries, most of them predominantly Muslim.

Harris has not yet issued an immigration policy platform. When talking about the issue during campaign events, Harris has mostly brought up the bipartisan border security deal that collapsed in Congress earlier this year after Trump urged GOP lawmakers to reject it. Harris has promised to revive the bill and accused Trump of scuttling it for political reasons.

Education

Trump says he wants to break up the Education Department. He's also said he wants to cut federal spending for any school pushing ""critical race theory"" or transgender matters.

Like many Republicans, Trump is also a proponent of school choice — enabling parents to use tax dollars toward private institutions, rather than public schools.

In 2018, a federal court approved a $25 million settlement with students who said they were misled by Trump and his now-defunct Trump University. The institution was supposed to teach them the real estate business. It operated from 2005 to 2010.

Climate

Trump has summed up his energy policy with the slogan ""drill, baby, drill."" He vows to make America the world's leading producer of oil and gas, in part by lifting restrictions on energy production.

Trump's energy plan, shared with CBS News via email, said he'd slash energy and electricity prices by more than half.

As president, Trump proposed large cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, which were ultimately rejected by the Democrat-led House Appropriations Committee. He told Fox News in June, ""One of the things that's so bad for us is environmental agencies. They make it impossible to do anything.""



Trump pulled out of the landmark Paris climate agreement in 2020 and his campaign says he would again exit the international treaty if he wins another term. The U.S. rejoined the agreement in 2021 — a decision announced

Trump vowed he will undo what he calls Biden's ""electric vehicle mandate"" on day one in office. The Biden-Harris administration has not issued any sort of mandate, but has introduced incentives to spur EV adoption at set goals and set a target that half of all new vehicle sales be zero emissions by 2030.

Guns

The NRA endorsed Trump in May at its annual convention, and he has addressed the group several times, including in 2022 shortly after the Uvalde shooting. At another NRA event in February, he vowed ""no one will lay a finger on your firearms.""

After the Las Vegas shooting in Oct. 2017, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms under the Trump administration moved forward with a ban on bump stocks, devices that greatly increase the rate of fire of semi-automatic weapons. The ban was later struck down by the Supreme Court

Israel and Gaza

Both Harris and Trump have at times been critical of Israel's handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza. But neither has threatened to pull support for the ally.

Trump, who has portrayed himself as a staunch defender of Israel, has criticized the Israeli government's handling of the war in Gaza. In a November interview with Univision, Trump commented on the war in Gaza, saying ""Israel has to do a better job of public relations, frankly, because the other side is beating them at the public relations front."" He also called on Israel to ""get it over with"" in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.

As president, Trump controversially moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and ended decades of U.S. opposition to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. (The Biden administration reversed the settlement decision.)

Ukraine and Russia

Trump has repeatedly claimed he could end the war in Ukraine in a day, though he has not outlined how he would do so. He has also claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin would never have invaded Ukraine under his administration.

Vance has been vocal about the GOP ticket's opposition to additional Ukraine aid. Trump himself pushed for a loan framework

Trump attempted to build friendly relations with Russia while in office and has often praised Putin, calling the Russian leader "" savvy

China

Trump has continued to talk tough against China while praising its leader Xi Jinping.

Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek in July that Taiwan should pay for U.S. protection.



In the Senate, Harris co-sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act. Trump signed both into law.

In a recent interview with Fox News host Mark Levin, Trump said he ""respected"" China and Xi, adding that he'd ""rather have a good relationship with China."" But he also accused the country of taking advantage of the U.S.

Trump has threatened to escalate his trade war with China, floating a tariff of 60% or more on Chinese goods.

Trump has also proposed revoking China's Most Favored Nation trade status, phasing out all imports of essential goods from China and banning China from buying U.S. farmland.

Iran nuclear deal

It's unclear whether Harris would seek to cut a new nuclear deal with Iran if she wins the election. Trump rejected the Obama-era deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and removed the U.S. from the international agreement.",left

In their only debate on Sept. 10, Americans heard what the candidates had to say about some of the most pressing issues facing the country, including the economy, immigration and abortion access.

Harris, a latecomer to the race after President Biden announced he was dropping out, did not announce many policies during her short campaign, but released some proposals and has her record as vice president.

Here are some key points from the plans she's offered, information about her record and what she has said about some of these subjects. (A similar overview of Trump's positions can be found here.)

Tax plan

Trump and Harris have competing tax plans. Both nominees' plans would have to be passed by Congress, which has the power of the purse. Here's what Harris has proposed so far:

Harris says she'd provide bigger tax benefits for families but would offset the costs by raising corporate taxes, while Trump has said he'd extend the tax cuts enacted in 2017.

Under Harris' tax plan, according to an analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, 95% of Americans would see lower taxes, and higher earners would pay more taxes. The top 0.1% — whose annual average income exceeds $14 million — would pay about $167,000 more in taxes.

Harris wants to eliminate federal taxes on tips, which Trump first proposed.

She also says she wants to provide a financial cushion for small businesses with a tenfold increase in the startup expense deduction — lifting it from $5,000 to $50,000. New businesses wouldn't need to claim the deduction in their first year, when many take losses and would not be able to use it. Instead, they'd be able to wait until they're profitable and use the deduction at that time. Businesses would also be able to take part of the deduction in one year and save the rest for future years.

Child tax credit

After Trump's running mate JD Vance of $6,000, although this would be for the

Harris also suggests a return to the pandemic-era expansion of the child tax credit, up to $3,600 for young children. She hasn't released income eligibility thresholds, but it's likely that it would phase out for those at higher income levels.

Earlier this year, Senate Republicans blocked legislation

Housing shortage

Harris says she'd address the nation's housing shortage with several initiatives. She promises to build 3 million affordable new homes and rentals by the end of her first term, offering tax breaks to builders who construct homes for first-time home buyers. She's also proposing a $40 billion fund to help local governments find solutions to the low housing stock.

And she wants to provide Americans who have paid their rent on time for two years with up to $25,000 in down-payment assistance, with more support for first-generation homeowners.

Inflation

Inflation has cooled nearly to pre-pandemic levels, but prices have risen nearly 21% since the beginning of the pandemic. A recent survey

Harris doubts

She also wants to lower prescription drug costs, which has been a focus for the Biden administration. Last month, the White House announced Medicare reached agreements with drug manufacturers for lower prices for 10 drugs that treat a range of ailments, from heart failure and blood clots to diabetes, resulting in savings for patients of 38% to 79%, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It was Harris who cast the tie-breaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, which granted Medicare the drug negotiating authority.

Immigration



Harris has not yet issued an immigration policy platform. At campaign events, Harris has mostly brought up the bipartisan border security deal that collapsed in Congress earlier this year after Trump urged GOP lawmakers to reject it. Harris has promised to revive the bill and accused Trump of scuttling it for political reasons.

The legislation would have enacted permanent restrictions on asylum, given the president the power to quickly deport migrants when border crossings soar and boosted the ranks of border agents, deportation officers, immigration judges and asylum adjudicators. It would also have expanded legal immigration, allocating 50,000 new immigrant visas annually for five years.

While the bipartisan border deal did not include a legalization program for undocumented immigrants — a longtime Democratic priority in immigration negotiations — Harris has expressed support for an ""earned"" path to citizenship for this population on the campaign trail.

Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Harris' campaign manager, signaled to CBS News

Harris' campaign has tried to distance her from the more liberal immigration positions she espoused when she was a presidential candidate in 2020. Those prior positions included an openness to decriminalizing the act of crossing the border without authorization and overhauling Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Abortion

Harris and Trump have opposing views on abortion access, an issue that could be a crucial motivator for voters in November.

Both Trump and Harris have highlighted the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade nearly one-third of states

Harris has made abortion rights a focal point of her campaign and lambasted ""Trump abortion bans"" on the trail.

In her speech at the Democratic National Convention accepting the party's presidential nominee, the vice president pledged to sign into law legislation that restores the federal right to abortion — if such a bill is passed by Congress.

IVF

Access to in vitro fertilization services became a campaign issue after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos created during the IVF process could be considered children. The decision threatened the availability of IVF services in Alabama and thrust access to fertility treatments into the national conversation, including among the presidential candidates.

Harris has repeatedly said she supports the right of women to make their own decisions about their bodies and family-planning, and told the crowd at the DNC that since Roe's reversal, she has heard stories of couples who have had their IVF treatments cut off.

The vice president said in a video shared to social media that Trump ""is literally the architect of this entire crisis,"" and said the Alabama ruling is a ""direct result"" of the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe.

Climate



Harris has not outlined her climate policy yet, but she is expected to continue to pursue the goals of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which funded energy and climate projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions by 40% by 2030.

As vice president, Harris advocates moving the country toward a ""clean energy economy"" while not completely backing away from oil and gas, which is a major industry in battleground states like Pennsylvania. The Keystone State is one of the top natural gas producers in the country.

In an interview with CNN, Harris said that as president, she wouldn't ban fracking — a technique for extracting natural gas from shale — a departure from a statement she made in 2019 that she'd support a fracking ban. Citing the creation of 300,000 clean energy jobs during the Biden administration, she told CNN that her experience as vice president shows ""we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.""

A Harris campaign spokesperson said 300,000 clean energy jobs were created under the Biden-Harris administration in both 2021 and 2022.

The Democratic Party platform almost 50% more gas and oil leases during his time in office than Trump did during his first three years in office.

At her speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris only made passing reference to gun violence. ""In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake,"" she said. ""The freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities and places of worship.""

Education

As a senator, Harris backed a bill that would have provided tuition-free college for most families.

The Democratic Party's platform also calls for free college tuition for all. This is not an idea Harris has been discussing on the campaign trail.

Israel and Gaza



Both Harris and Trump have, at times, been critical of Israel's handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza. But neither has threatened to pull support for the ally.

Harris has called vowed

She has pushed for a cease-fire deal that would release the remaining hostages held by Hamas.

She backs a two-state solution.

Ukraine and Russia

Harris pledged in her DNC address that she ""will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.""

Harris accused

The Biden administration has spearheaded a number of aid packages for Ukraine, including weapons, and worked with allies to sanction Russia for its invasion. Still, the administration's response — especially early on in the war — has been criticized as slow-moving, and more recently, Republican opposition in Congress further slowed aid to Ukraine.

China

Harris has offered few details about how her China policy would differ from Mr. Biden's. In her Democratic National Convention speech, Harris said ""America — not China — wins the competition for the 21st century.""

She told

Harris briefly met Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2022 in Bangkok amid friction between the two countries. The vice president said she stressed the need to ""maintain open lines of communication to responsibly manage the competition between our countries.""

She has condemned China's aggression in the South China Sea, accusing it of ""undermining key elements of the international rules-based order"" and coercing and intimidating its neighbors.

Harris has also reaffirmed U.S. support for Taiwan.

In the Senate, Harris cosponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act. Trump signed both into law.

Iran nuclear deal

It's unclear whether Harris would seek to renegotiate a new nuclear deal with Iran if she wins the election. During the 2020 campaign, Harris, who was running in a crowded Democratic presidential primary, told the Council on Foreign Relations that she would seek to rejoin the Iran nuclear agreement, ""so long as Iran also returned to verifiable compliance.""",left
59,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-election-results-map-shift-red/,Map shows Trump's 2024 election victory came as voters shifted red across the country,"While the 2024 presidential election was among the closest in recent memory — with President-elect Donald Trump ahead by about 3 percentage points over Vice President Kamala Harris — Trump's vote share grew in a diverse array of regions across the country and across different demographic groups.

It's the first time in Trump's three campaigns for the White House that he's topped his opponent in the popular vote, and only the second time since 1988 that any Republican has done so. In 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won almost 66 million votes (48%), compared to Trump's nearly 63 million (46%), but Trump won the Electoral College. In 2020, he lost both the Electoral College and the popular vote to President Biden, who received about 81 million votes (51%) nationwide, compared to Trump's 74 million (47%).

Trump's victory in 2024 was driven by improvements in support in a vast majority of counties nationwide — more than 9 in 10 — according to data from counties where at least 95% of votes have been counted as of Friday. Trump's improvements crossed regions, and included urban, suburban and rural gains.

Trump even fared better in most places where a majority of voters preferred Harris, like New Jersey, or across the Hudson River, in his hometown of New York City.

The Garden State, a longtime Democratic stronghold, swung markedly in Trump's favor. For instance, the latest data show Trump with a slim 3% lead in suburban Passaic County, where he got just 41% of the vote in 2020.

In New York City, where Trump grew up and spent most of his life before entering politics, he didn't just surpass his two previous results; his roughly 30% vote share topped every Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan, 40 years ago.

Nearly 2,000 miles away, Maverick County, Texas, a majority Latino border county that Biden carried easily in 2020, swung even more, about 28 points. Trump in 2024 outperformed Biden's 2020 showing, and Harris fared worse than Trump did in 2020.

CBS News exit polls from the last two elections showed Trump gaining among both men and women this year. In 2020, Trump won men by a hair, 49% to 48%, but in 2024, his campaign's efforts to woo men appear to have paid off: his support from men grew to 55%.

In 2020, Trump managed to win 43% of women voters. In 2024, despite Democrats' focus on women voters and abortion access, which boosted them in the midterm election races, Trump still increased his numbers with women, notching up that figure two ticks, to 45%.

Trump made gains among core groups within the traditional Republican coalition, such as evangelical voters. But he also increased his support among groups Democrats have relied on, including young voters and Latino voters, such as those in Maverick County and another former Democratic stronghold, Florida's Miami-Dade, which Mr. Biden won in 2020, with 53%. This year, Trump carried the county with about 55% of the vote, becoming the first Republican to win there since 1988.
