The administration did not give the judges a reason for why they were fired.\nThere are more than 700 immigration judges, each of whom handles between 500 and 700 cases a year, Mr. Biggs said. Most of the cases are related to deportation, which is one of the top issues Mr. Trump is focused on.\n“It’s inexplicable,” Mr. Biggs said in an interview on Saturday. “It’s contrary to what the president campaigned on, and it makes no sense at all.”\nImmigration judges are part of the administrative court system and housed in the Justice Department. They make decisions about asylum claims and decide who should be removed from the country. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nImmigration courts have been facing a growing backlog, which has contributed to the number of undocumented immigrants in the country. Because cases take so long to wind through the system, many of those waiting start putting down roots in their communities.\nOne of the immigration judges who were dismissed, Kerry E. Doyle, announced her firing on LinkedIn. She was among the incoming class of new judges and had not yet announced her new position on social media, she said.\n“Unfortunately, I was unable to avoid the political pink slip,” Ms. Doyle wrote on LinkedIn. She served as the principal legal adviser at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “This firing occurred despite the fact that among my peers in my court, I had the longest and most extensive experience in immigration law,” she wrote.\nMs. Doyle wrote a memo during the Biden administration, instructing lawyers at ICE to review cases and try to clear those considered low priority.\nThe Trump administration has been carrying out mass firings across the government.

Putin of Russia, Mr. Trump is on his way to agreeing to terms that could ultimately put Moscow in a position to own a fifth of Ukraine and to prepare to take the rest in a few years’ time. Mr. Putin’s ultimate goal, they believe, is to break up the NATO alliance.\nThose fears spilled out on the stage of the Munich Security Conference on Saturday morning, when President Volodymyr Zelensky declared that “Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs.” He then called optimistically for the creation of an “army of Europe,” one that includes his now battle-hardened Ukrainian forces. He was advocating, in essence, a military alternative to NATO, a force that would make its own decisions without the influence — or the military control — of the United States.\nMr. Zelensky predicted that Mr. Putin would soon seek to manipulate Mr. Trump, speculating that the Russian leader would invite the new American president to the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany. “Putin will try to get the U.S. president standing on Red Square on May 9 this year,” he told a jammed hall of European diplomats and defense and intelligence officials, “not as a respected leader but as a prop in his own performance.”\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Republican senators voiced private skepticism about her qualifications, and her stances on Russia and Syria were at odds with the party’s old positions. But, on a party-line vote on Wednesday, the Senate approved Ms. Gabbard to serve in the senior intelligence post.\nAfter all of the Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee endorsed her nomination, her confirmation was all but assured. Those private worries of Republican lawmakers never became significant public opposition. Elon Musk, President Trump’s billionaire ally, \n one Republican whose vote was in doubt, and Ms. Gabbard worked the halls to win over the support of the wavering lawmakers.\nHere are four takeaways about Ms. Gabbard’s road to confirmation and her mandate going forward.\nWhen Mr. Trump made his initial announcements of his choices for key roles in his cabinet, there was lots of hand-wringing, even from some Republican senators. One pick, former Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, withdrew after his first day of concerted lobbying in Senate offices. But Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Kash Patel and Ms. Gabbard hung on, working Republican senators who were on the fence. Democrats were unimpressed with Ms. Gabbard’s efforts. But that did not matter. She \n.\nThe bottom line is that it is all but impossible to defeat a cabinet member on the floor of the Senate in the current age. No nominee has been rejected since 1989, when John Tower, President George H.W. Bush’s pick for defense secretary, was rejected, 47 to 53. Since then, cabinet nominees facing doubts in Congress have withdrawn. But a nominee with the support of the president, and the tenacity to take criticism, has a good chance of getting through.\nMs. Gabbard adjusted her position on warrantless wiretaps of overseas communications. She promised not to oppose reauthorization of the measure, a key switch in time that reassured Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana and one of the fence sitters.\nBut Ms. Gabbard stood her ground on Edward Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who released a huge amount of classified information on secret surveillance programs.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

He issued a proclamation making it “Gulf of America Day” while on Air Force One, ceremoniously cementing his executive order last month to rename the Gulf of Mexico.\nOf greater significance, he announced that, starting Monday, he would impose a 25 percent tariff on all foreign steel and aluminum imports into the United States. He also said he still intended to move forward with taking over the Gaza Strip, which he described as a “big real estate site” that the United States was “going to own.”\nHe criticized a judge’s ruling against efforts by Elon Musk’s cost-cutting team to gain access to Treasury systems. And he defended his first three weeks in office, which have caused massive strife across the country and the globe.\nThat was all before the game started.\nMr. Trump was met with cheers and a mix of boos as he arrived at the Superdome for the game, between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. Among his entourage were his son Eric Trump and Eric’s wife, Lara Trump; his daughter Ivanka Trump; and several Republican leaders.\nAlso at the game is the former first lady Jill Biden, an avid Eagles fan, and her grandson, Beau Biden’s son Hunter.

The National Institutes of Health, which announced the move Friday evening, said \n — or about 26 percent — of grant dollars distributed last year had gone to overhead.\nThe new policy, which takes effect on Monday, will cap “indirect funds” for costs like buildings, utilities and support staff at 15 percent and is aimed at saving $4 billion.\nDr. David J. Skorton, president of the Association of American Medical Colleges, said the policy would sharply cut funds to universities and medical centers that do N.I.H.-funded research, likely limiting the number of studies that could go forward.\n“These are real consequences, longer waits for cures and for diagnosis, slower scientific progress, losing out to competitors around the world, and fewer jobs,” he said, adding: “Those who are facing any health challenges will suffer from less biomedical research.”\nDr. Robert Lefkowitz, a Duke University professor of medicine who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2012, said that indirect funds pay for the purchase and maintenance of highly sophisticated microscopes that enable him to examine the structure of molecules.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Kennedy Jr. for health secretary and Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence.\nThe party-line committee votes to send both nominees to the floor for likely confirmation next week provided the clearest evidence yet that Mr. Trump’s pressure tactics and the threat of a barrage of abuse by his allies against would-be defectors had sapped whatever remained of a G.O.P. impulse to balk. And they suggested a broader impulse among Republicans on Capitol Hill — even the few who have maintained some degree of independence from Mr. Trump — to shrink from confrontation with him and allow him to have his way at the dawn of his second term.\nThe decision by Senator Todd Young of Indiana to back Ms. Gabbard, in conjunction with the announcement of Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana that he was setting aside personal reservations to back Mr. Kennedy, marked the end of any serious effort to stop Mr. Trump’s most divisive nominees.\nTogether with the narrowest possible confirmation of Pete Hegseth last month as secretary of defense, the moves constituted a surrender by Senate Republicans to Mr. Trump even in the face of serious qualms among some in the G.O.P. Another nominee who had initially been seen as facing a potentially difficult path to confirmation, Kash Patel for director of the F.B.I., has impressed Republicans and seems headed for approval as well despite strong Democratic objections.\nThough a handful of senators had walked up to the edge of rejecting one or another nominee, putting their confirmations in peril, all but a very few backtracked in the end, issuing statements that they had received promises and assurances from both the nominee and the White House that had eliminated their chief concerns.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump’s global business empire created an \n number of \n of \n for a sitting president. Ethics experts worried that opportunists could try to curry favor by booking stays at Mr. Trump’s network of hotels, golf clubs and other properties.\n \nTheir predictions bore out: Foreign governments and lobbyists \n at his Washington hotel, which has since been sold, as well as at his Mar-a-Lago resort and other properties. The federal government itself also became an awkward customer by \n’ worth of rooms at his hotels and clubs.\n \nThose concerns now seem almost quaint in light of some of Mr. Trump’s more recent business ventures. They include a publicly traded company, several cryptocurrency ventures, new overseas real estate deals involving state-affiliated entities and numerous branding and licensing deals.\n \nThe new additions to Mr. Trump’s portfolio could provide more direct avenues for those wishing to influence a sitting president or even to try to extort him, according to some outside ethics lawyers.\n \nSeveral of Mr. Trump’s recent real estate projects have connections to foreign governments in the Middle East, raising concerns that Mr. Trump’s financial interests could influence foreign policy.\n \nNew international real estate deals\nExisting properties\nU.S.\nIreland\nScotland\nSouth Korea\nTurkey\nU.A.E.\nIndia\nVietnam\nSaudi Arabia\nSt. Martin\nPhilippines\nOman\nIndonesia\nUruguay\nU.S.\nIreland\nScotland\nSouth Korea\nTurkey\nU.A.E.\nIndia\nVietnam\nSaudi Arabia\nSt. Martin\nPhilippines\nOman\nIndonesia\nUruguay\nMany of the contracts that the Trump family has negotiated overseas since Mr. Trump left office are so-called branding deals. The Trump family sells its name to international developers that build residential and resort complexes and sell luxury units at a premium, they hope, based on Mr. Trump’s perceived star power.\n \nOne of the developments\n a luxury hotel and golf course complex in the Middle Eastern nation of Oman, is being built on land owned by the country’s government. That project and three others are proceeding in partnership with a subsidiary of a Saudi-based real estate company, Dar Al Arkan, which has \n with the Saudi government. Saudi Arabia has a long list of pressing matters before the United States, including requests to buy F-35 fighter jets and gain access to \n.\n \nOman also plays an important role in the Middle East, often serving as a middleman between the United States and Iran.\n \nIt is extremely unusual, historians say, for any U.S. president to be involved in family business deals with a foreign government nexus at the same time as he is managing  foreign policy matters that affect that same nation.\n \n, the Trump family \nlaunch  World Liberty Financial, a platform for investors to borrow and lend using cryptocurrencies. The Trump family members are not owners or officers in the company, but they have an agreement to be paid for helping promote it.\n \nWorld Liberty Financial\nOn the campaign trail,\nMr. Trump vowed to\nsupport the\ncrypto industry.\nEthereum\nMr. Trump reported\nowning between\n$1 million and $5 million\nof this cryptocurrency.\nTrump memecoin\nDays before his inauguration,\nMr. Trump announced the launch\nof a new token, known as $TRUMP.\nWorld Liberty Financial\nOn the campaign trail,\nMr. Trump vowed to support\nthe crypto industry.\nEthereum\nMr. Trump reported owning\nbetween $1 million and $5 million\nof this cryptocurrency.\nTrump memecoin\nDays before his inauguration,\nMr. Trump announced the launch\nof a new token, known as $TRUMP.\nAfter getting off to a rocky start, the company got a boost in the form of a \n by Justin Sun, a cryptocurrency executive who has been targeted by the Securities and Exchange Commission on fraud claims unrelated to World Liberty Financial. Mr. Sun has \n the case.\n \nAs of November, World Liberty claimed to have at least \n who have bought a stake in what the company calls a “platform inspired by Donald J. Trump.” These purchases were made even though the tokens — at least for now — cannot be resold, meaning they have no immediate value to the buyers.\n \nBut the purchases, made by individuals whose names are not public, should generate \n of dollars in payments to the Trump family, according to company filings.\n \nMr. Trump has already seen the effect he can have on the cryptocurrency market. When he announced his pick for S.E.C. chairman, the crypto advocate and lawyer Paul Atkins, Bitcoin value surged above $100,000 for the first time in its history. Mr. Trump immediately moved to claim credit for the milestone. “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!,” he \n on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n \nMr. Trump himself, according to his 2024 financial disclosure, owned as much as $5 million worth of Ethereum, a token second only to Bitcoin in popularity. That cryptocurrency has also \n since the election.\n \nAnd just days before his second inauguration, Mr. Trump and his family directly entered the cryptocurrency business themselves, for the first time selling their own new crypto token called $TRUMP, a deal that generated tens of millions of dollars in transaction fees and potentially billions of dollars for the family through future token sales.\n \nThis move immediately generated a wave of criticism of the Trump family from many in the cryptocurrency industry, as well as from ethics lawyers. That is because it is generating profits for the family, even though many unsophisticated buyers are already losing money on the bet, as the price on these tokens crashed after surging when they were first introduced.\n \nThe new leadership at the S.E.C. is likely to decide on rules that could significantly increase the value of Ethereum, Bitcoin and, in particular, the tokens the Trump family is helping sell at World Liberty Financial. Those rules could also pave the way for World Liberty to market its coins to a wider swath of the public, which would potentially generate hundreds of millions of dollars in additional payouts to Mr. Trump and his family.\n \nLast spring, Trump Media & Technology Group, which is the parent company of Truth Social and the president-elect’s single greatest source of wealth, went public.

holdings in a trust, but the trust was controlled by his two oldest sons instead of an independent entity, which is more the norm. He \n that there would be “no new deals” by his company involving international real estate projects while he was in the White House.\n \nThis month, the Trump family issued an \n that revived many of the earlier promises with one key distinction: The Trump family intends to continue to do new international real estate deals, as long as the counterparties are not foreign governments themselves.\n \nEric Trump, the family member most responsible for overseeing the Trump Organization and its new deals, said the family is committed to avoiding any transactions that exploit connections to the White House. The company has appointed a well-known outside ethics lawyer, a former federal prosecutor and corporate lawyer named William A. Burck, to review any new contracts worth more than $10 million. “The Trump Organization is dedicated to not just meeting but vastly exceeding its legal and ethical obligations during my father’s presidency,” Eric Trump said in a statement.\n \nCertain ethics lawyers have argued that some of Mr. Trump’s conflicts of interest are not only a problem, but that they also represent a violation of the so-called emoluments clause in the Constitution, which prohibits a president from certain payments from any foreign government. The president and vice president are not exempt from this provision, as they are from conflict of interest laws that require other senior federal officials to divest from companies that might benefit from their official actions.\n \nSeveral lawsuits filed against Mr. Trump during his first term argued that he had violated the emoluments clause by \n he then owned in Washington, among other business operations.\n \nHis first term ended before the federal court system could definitively rule on questions related to emoluments, although the courts did ultimately allow the cases to proceed, suggesting that it remained possible that the outcome could have been against Mr. Trump.\n \nBut the clock ran out and the Supreme Court ruled that the cases were moot as soon as he left office. The legal fight would have to start all over again, but there is likely to be an allegation that the Trump Organization’s continued business deals through some of its subsidiaries with foreign governments is unconstitutional or illegal, these ethics lawyers said.\n \nIn the past 50 years, incoming U.S. presidents have voluntarily taken steps to disentangle themselves from any activities that could be perceived as a conflict of interest or moneymaking venture during their time in office.\n \nJimmy Carter turned over his peanut farm to a trust, which he learned after he left the White House was deeply in debt. Ronald Reagan announced within two weeks of his inauguration that he had sold off all of his investments, other than his ranch and another home, \n that was then managed by an independent trustee. Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife put her Texas radio and television holdings \n.\n \nBut these issues have created questions before — a point Mr. Trump’s family and lawyer raised this month when they laid out Mr. Trump’s own ethics plan. When George Washington was president, the Trump lawyers noted, he continued to own a business that exported flour and cornmeal to Europe and the Caribbean. In the 1970s, Vice President Nelson Rockefeller maintained \n, which his grandfather founded.\n \nIn Mr. Trump’s case, questions about real or potential conflicts extend beyond the president-elect.\n \nHis oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., announced recently that he is joining the venture capital firm 1789 Capital, which focuses on investing in conservative companies and could see its business boosted as a result of its ties to the first family. Mr. Trump’s son Barron is playing a role in World Liberty Financial, as are Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, according to \n.\n \nAnd Jared Kushner, the president-elect’s son-in-law, runs a private equity firm called Affinity Partners that has raised $4.5 billion, \n of the oil-rich nations of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, based on relationships he built while in the White House during Mr. Trump’s first term. Mr. Kushner does not plan to return to the White House. But his ties to Mr. Trump will create new ethics concerns as he continues to make investments over the next four years, including \n and Serbia, where the governments there are his partners.\n \nMost of these potential conflicts did not exist the first time Mr. Trump was in office. It all means these kinds of questions are only going to be more intense this White House term.\n \nNote: Illustrations include assets that are listed in Donald J. Trump’s most recent financial disclosure or are highlighted on the Trump Organization website. Assets listed as “inactive” in the financial disclosure are not included."},

Though the law was enacted in 1977, federal authorities have more heavily enforced it since around 2005, cracking down on bribery, especially in countries where it is a common business practice.\nMr. Trump has objected to the law, which has led to charges and huge fines against some of the world’s largest companies. In November, U.S. prosecutors \n Gautam Adani, the Indian tycoon, of bribing Indian officials and charged him with fraud. His company has called those claims “baseless.”\nCompanies that have paid fines under the act include the engineering conglomerate \n and the Swedish telecommunications company \n.

The administration will also review existing investigations launched under the act, it said, to “restore proper bounds” on the law.\nIt also directs the attorney general to issue new guidance on how to enforce the act “that promotes American competitiveness and efficient use of federal law enforcement resources.”\nEnforcement of the act has \n in the past two decades as business has become increasingly globalized.

He said in a 2012 CNBC interview that “the world is laughing at us” for enforcing the law, and in 2017 he nominated Jay Clayton, a lawyer who had expressed skepticism about U.S. antibribery policies, to run the S.E.C.\nMr. Trump wanted to strike down the law in his first term, \n to the book “A Very Stable Genius,” by the Washington Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol D. Leonnig. They wrote that, in a 2017 briefing, Mr. Trump told the secretary of state at the time, Rex W. Tillerson, that the law was “so unfair” to American companies.\nMr. Trump also told a policy adviser to draft an executive action to repeal the law, they wrote. But the adviser, Stephen Miller, responded that he was skeptical about that plan, and it ultimately did not come to fruition."},

Mr. Trump and his allies believe that left-leaning bureaucrats will work to thwart his agenda and that he should have far more power than past presidents to install proven loyalists throughout the government.\nTo that end, Mr. Trump’s order, titled “One Voice for America’s Foreign Relations,” directs the secretary of state to “implement reforms in recruiting, performance, evaluation and retention standards.” It also directs officials to “revise or replace the Foreign Affairs Manual,” along with “any handbooks, procedures or guidance” governing diplomacy.\nThe executive order also makes explicit the price of defying Mr. Trump’s orders. “Failure to faithfully implement the president’s policy is grounds for professional discipline, including separation,” it says.\nAll foreign policy arms of the government, it adds, must devise “an effective and efficient means” of ensuring that the president’s orders are followed.\nThe executive order would appear to challenge basic and longstanding principles of the Foreign Service: that career diplomats should be hired based on their qualifications and expertise, not their political views, and that dissent should be welcomed and not punished.\nAs part of the federal civil service, professional diplomats enjoy special job protections against partisanship and political retribution. Mr. Trump seems intent on weakening those protections.\nIn an initial statement, the American Foreign Service Association, which represents professional diplomats, said it was still assessing the impact of the order. But the group noted that its members posted around the world “carry out the foreign policy initiatives of the president, regardless of party.”\n“We hope that any administration would value the expertise and knowledge of the Foreign Service, including its ability to provide advice on foreign policy matters,” the statement said, adding that the group would “always defend the integrity and nonpolitical nature of the Foreign Service so that our members can continue to serve the American people.”\nSeparately, State Department officials are grappling with more proposed cuts to personnel.

Rush to Confirm Trump Nominees", "body": "Senate Republicans had hoped to rush through confirmation of a flurry of Cabinet nominees in the days immediately after President Trump assumed office. But Democrats, expressing reservations about some picks, are slowing the push, frustrating Republicans and denying the new president the quick action he demanded.\n“What this is really about is trying to drag out all of these nominations, to play procedural games,” Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the No. 3 Republican, said Tuesday as Democrats blocked quick confirmation of John Ratcliffe to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency. “We are going to get these nominees done the easy, collegial way — or apparently the hard way.”\nHours after Mr. Trump was sworn in, Democrats agreed to the speedy 99-0 confirmation of Marco Rubio, their Senate colleague, to be secretary of state. But they have since shown that they are willing to use procedural tactics to slow other nominees even if they are destined for confirmation, including forcing time-consuming floor votes on action that is usually done by mutual agreement.\nDemocrats said some Trump picks merited closer scrutiny.\n“If every one of President Trump’s nominees were as qualified and experienced as Senator Rubio, they would sail through the Senate with bipartisan support,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and minority leader, said. “But sadly, too many of the president’s nominees do not match Senator Rubio’s caliber. Too many have troubling backgrounds. Too many seem unprepared for the job, and proved so during testimony.”\nThe slow early pace has drawn the attention of Mr. Trump, who in a meeting on Tuesday with the two top congressional Republicans at the White House resurrected the idea of bypassing the Senate altogether on nominations and trying to install his picks without votes while the Senate is in recess. Senate Republicans balked at the idea when the president first raised it after his election win, but Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican and majority leader, did not rule out the approach if Democrats persist with what his side considers needless delays.\n“Obviously, that’s something that, as you know, he’s expressed an interest in in the past,” Mr. Thune said of Mr. Trump and recess appointments. “I think we’re going to find out here fairly quickly whether or not the Democrats want to help us get through some of these nominations in a way that gets us back on track with the way it was done prior to the last two presidencies.”\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

He was the first national intelligence chief installed without support from the opposition party.\nBut now, senators from both parties view Mr. Ratcliffe as one of the more qualified senior officials picked by Mr. Trump, whose focus on the threat from China is widely shared by Republican and Democratic lawmakers.\nMr. Ratcliffe used his opening comments to outline his vision of an agency that offers intelligence free of political bias. While he said he would not discuss specific intelligence priorities, he promised he would make the C.I.A. less averse to risk and more willing to conduct covert action when ordered by the president, “going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do.”\nIn his opening statement, Mr. Ratcliffe promised that the C.I.A. would collect intelligence in every part of the globe, “no matter how dark or difficult.”\nHe also pledged that the agency’s analysis would be objective, “never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgment or infect our products.”\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

In making the move, the president was testing the limits of his power, trying to push past the federal law that governs payouts and rules that have long protected the civil service from political interference and pressure.\nThe move also risked gutting the staffs of a wide array of federal agencies that Americans depend on, though federal unions immediately condemned the offer, and many federal employees viewed it as a trick.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Laplante of the U.S. District Court in New Hampshire said he would issue an injunction immediately, and that he would follow it on Tuesday with an explanatory order detailing his reasoning.\nThe executive order has already been blocked indefinitely by a federal judge in Maryland, who issued a nationwide injunction last week, and by a similar action by another federal judge in Seattle.\nThe Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration — both legal and illegal — has prompted at least 10 lawsuits, seven of them challenging his executive order about birthright citizenship.\nThe federal lawsuit filed in New Hampshire was brought by three state branches of the American Civil Liberties Union, in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine. Two other organizations, the Asian Law Caucus and the State Democracy Defenders Fund, helped file the suit \n that assist immigrants, including New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support.\nCody Wofsy, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, argued in court on Monday that Mr. Trump’s order violated the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to virtually all persons born on U.S. soil, and that it then “piled on” a violation of the separation of powers clause.\n“They say the president needs flexibility to rewrite our citizenship rules, the DNA of this country, and that is just not the Constitution we live under,” Mr. Wofsy told the judge, who was nominated by President George W. Bush.\nDrew Ensign, representing the government, argued that children of undocumented immigrants have a divided allegiance, and ties to “a foreign power,” that must be considered in deciding their citizenship status.\nThe executive order declared that children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants after Feb. 19 would not be treated as citizens.

There are no limits on campaign contributions in Virginia state elections.\nMs. Spanberger, 45, is considered the favorite to win the Democratic nomination, with no other top-tier Democrat so far in the race. She is expected to face the state’s Republican lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, 60 and a Marine veteran herself. The contest, along with a race for governor in New Jersey, will be closely watched this fall for signs of the nation’s political direction 10 months into President Trump’s second term.\n“We know that investing in candidates like Abigail is key to Democrats’ success,” VoteVets wrote in a memo provided to The New York Times, noting that 600,000 veterans and 120,000 active-duty service members live in Virginia.\nA \n released last month showed Ms. Earle-Sears narrowly behind Ms. Spanberger, 44 percent to 47 percent, and slightly ahead of Representative Bobby Scott, Democrat of Virginia, 46 percent to 44 percent.\nMr. Scott has not ruled out a run, but he has not sounded like a candidate of late, \n this month that Mr. Trump is “keeping me too busy in Washington right now.”\nMs. Spanberger ended last year with $6.5 million in the bank, and Ms. Earle-Sears had $2.1 million, \n. The race is expected to cost far more than that.\nMs. Spanberger flipped a Republican-held congressional seat in 2018, part of a class of moderate Democrats who helped take the House in a Democratic landslide. She used her history as a covert C.I.A. officer overseas \n in a district that included the suburbs of Richmond, Va., and parts of exurban Washington.\nDuring the Biden years, she cautioned her party against overreaching, especially after Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, won the Virginia governorship in 2021.\n she said of President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at the time, urging him to temper his sweeping agenda. “They elected him to be normal and stop the chaos.”\nIn its memo, VoteVets, which spent roughly $30 million during the 2024 elections, noted that a number of Democratic candidates with national security credentials won key races last year, including Senators Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Ruben Gallego of Arizona, both of whom succeeded in states that Mr. Trump carried.\n“We understand greatly the need to recruit and build up a roster of veteran and military candidates to retake the House and Senate,” the group wrote."},

Those penalties would increase if the chase resulted in injury or death, and if the person was not a citizen, they would be subject to deportation.\nLike other legislation Republicans have brought up in recent weeks to target immigrants, the bill drew dozens of Democratic votes; \n, with 50 Democrats joining all Republicans in favor. It next goes to the Senate.\nThe bill is named for Raul Gonzalez, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent who died in 2022 during a high-speed chase of migrants in Texas.\nRepresentative Juan Ciscomani, Republican of Arizona and one of the bill’s sponsors, said such dangerous chases involving law enforcement and migrants attempting to enter the country illegally \n in his district, which is along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n“For far too long, these individuals have not faced federal consequences for their actions that often end in tragedy, as it did for Border Patrol agent Raul Gonzalez in 2022 and innocent bystanders along the border,” he said in a statement after the vote. “This bill delivers a clear message to anyone who endangers our community that they will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”\nBut many Democrats denounced the legislation as overly broad and excessively punitive, noting that it could subject green card holders and other legal immigrants to deportation, and could lead to penalties even without a criminal charge or conviction.\n“Americans rightly demand a secure border and fair immigration system,” Representative Nellie Pou, Democrat of New Jersey, said in a statement. “I agree with them. But this is yet another overly-punitive immigration bill that seeks to demonize legal immigrants in our district and represents a solution in search of a problem.”\nHouse Republicans passed a nearly identical measure last year, but it stalled in the Senate, which was then controlled by Democrats. With Republicans now controlling both chambers and the White House, the legislation has a smoother path. Last month, Mr. Trump signed into law a bill that would target undocumented immigrants charged with nonviolent crimes for deportation.\n“Republicans will continue to take decisive action and echo President Trump’s leadership to deliver what is necessary to protect the American people and secure our borders,” Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, said in a statement after the bill’s passage."},

That includes not only the tariffs that other countries charge the United States, but also the taxes they charge on foreign products, the subsidies they give their industries, their exchange rates, and other behaviors the president deems unfair.\nThe president has said the step was necessary to even out America’s “unfair” relationships and stop other countries from taking advantage of the United States on trade. But he made clear that his ultimate goal was to force companies to bring their manufacturing back to the United States.\n“If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,” he said during remarks in the Oval Office.\nHoward Lutnick, the president’s nominee for commerce secretary, said the measures could be ready as soon as April 2. He will oversee the plan along with Jamieson Greer, Mr. Trump’s pick for trade representative, if they both are confirmed to those posts, and other advisers.\nThe decision to rework the tariffs that America charges on imported goods would represent a dramatic overhaul of the global trading system.

Order", "body": "A group of nongovernmental organizations, contractors and small businesses that rely on American foreign aid to carry out humanitarian and development programs abroad filed a lawsuit in federal court on Tuesday against the Trump administration and its efforts to phase out the U.S. Agency for International Development.\nThe plaintiffs charge that the Trump administration “violated the separation of powers” by withholding foreign aid funds that Congress appropriated and, in the process, put their companies, the livelihoods of their employees and the vast majority of their aid work in critical jeopardy.\n“These programs cannot simply be restarted on command,” the lawsuit states. “U.S.A.I.D.’s partners are hemorrhaging resources and employees.” The suit adds that no provision of any appropriations bill or law “authorizes the president, secretary of state or U.S.A.I.D. administrator to impose a wholesale freeze or termination of appropriated foreign assistance funding.”\nThe Trump administration has argued that the agency wastes taxpayers’ money on costly and unfocused overseas programs that do little for the American people. The White House and U.S.A.I.D. referred requests for comment to the State Department; a spokesperson for State said the department did not comment on pending litigation.\nThe suit seeks to overturn President Trump’s executive order pausing foreign aid for 90 days pending a review, as well as all subsequent memos and directives from State Department and U.S.A.I.D. officials to implement that order. It lists the specific hits that several of the companies involved in the suit have taken in recent weeks, including to lifesaving health and humanitarian aid programs, despite promises from the Trump administration to issue waivers to keep such programs functioning.\nThe lawsuit comes on the heels of another filed by unions representing U.S.A.I.D. employees. Last Friday, Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, a 2019 Trump appointee, issued a restraining order pausing the imminent administrative leave of 2,200 U.S.A.I.D. employees and a plan to withdraw nearly all of the agency’s overseas workers within 30 days. He also ordered the temporary reinstatement of 500 agency employees who had already been placed on administrative leave.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The lawyers knew that those who had already refused had resigned, and they could also be forced out.\nBy Friday afternoon, a veteran prosecutor in the section, Ed Sullivan, agreed to submit the request in Manhattan federal court to shield his colleagues from being fired, or resigning en masse, according to three people briefed on the interaction, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\nThe filing landed in the court docket Friday evening, bearing the name of Mr. Sullivan and that of a criminal division supervisor as well as the signature of Mr. Bove.\nMr. Bove, the filing said, “concluded that dismissal is necessary because of appearances of impropriety and risks of interference with the 2025 elections in New York City.” The stated justification was remarkable because of its acknowledgment that politics, not the evidence in the case, had played a guiding role.\nOn Thursday, six lawyers — the Trump-appointed acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and five prosecutors in Washington — resigned rather than accede to Mr. Bove’s demands.

It also appears to give the officials the ability to expel migrants in two major Biden-era programs that have allowed more than a million people to enter the country temporarily.\nThose programs — an app called CBP One that migrants could use to try to schedule appointments to enter the United States, and an initiative that let in certain migrants fleeing Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti — were key pillars of the Biden administration’s efforts to discourage illegal entries by allowing certain legal pathways. Immigrant advocates also worried that the memo could apply to Afghan and Ukrainian immigrants brought to the United States under separate programs.\nThe decision indicates that President Trump will try to use every facet of the immigration enforcement apparatus to crack down on a system he has long said has been abused, and that he intends to target not just those who sneaked across the border but even those who followed previously authorized pathways to enter.\nIt is also sure to raise fears among a large class of immigrants, many of whom had fled desperate conditions, believed that they were in the country legally and might be afraid to return to their often-dangerous home countries.\nBoth of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s signature programs had faced heavy criticism from Republicans, including Trump administration officials, as a way to facilitate illegal immigration through the guise of a government program. The migrants were given a grant to stay in the country for up to two years under a temporary legal status known as “parole.” The memo appears to allow for their deportation, regardless of whether they have reached the end of that legal status or still have time remaining.\nTrump wants to end several programs that offered new arrivals temporary relief. Millions of others without legal status may also be vulnerable to deportation.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

It also appears to give the officials the ability to expel migrants in two major Biden-era programs that have allowed more than a million people to enter the country temporarily.\nThose programs — an app called CBP One that migrants could use to try to schedule appointments to enter the United States, and an initiative that let in certain migrants fleeing Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti — were key pillars of the Biden administration’s efforts to discourage illegal entries by allowing certain legal pathways. Immigrant advocates also worried that the memo could apply to Afghan and Ukrainian immigrants brought to the United States under separate programs.\nThe decision indicates that President Trump will try to use every facet of the immigration enforcement apparatus to crack down on a system he has long said has been abused, and that he intends to target not just those who sneaked across the border but even those who followed previously authorized pathways to enter.\nIt is also sure to raise fears among a large class of immigrants, many of whom had fled desperate conditions, believed that they were in the country legally and might be afraid to return to their often-dangerous home countries.\nBoth of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s signature programs had faced heavy criticism from Republicans, including Trump administration officials, as a way to facilitate illegal immigration through the guise of a government program. The migrants were given a grant to stay in the country for up to two years under a temporary legal status known as “parole.” The memo appears to allow for their deportation, regardless of whether they have reached the end of that legal status or still have time remaining.\nTrump wants to end several programs that offered new arrivals temporary relief. Millions of others without legal status may also be vulnerable to deportation.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

In unveiling the plan, Mr. Trump did not cite any legal authority giving him the right to take over the territory, nor did he address the fact that forcible removal of a population violates international law and decades of American foreign policy consensus in both parties.\nHe made the proposal even as the United States was seeking to secure the Israel-Hamas cease-fire’s second phase, which is designed to free the remaining hostages in Gaza and bring a permanent end to the fighting.

Ms. Cheng had been with the department since 2009.\nIn Mr. Trump’s first term, his administration sought to reshape the immigration court system by instituting quotas for judges and no longer allowing them to pause cases that they felt were not a priority. It also altered when immigration judges could grant asylum to migrants appearing in court.\n“The firing of these senior immigration court officials will be a severe setback to the effective functioning of the courts which are already backlogged with millions of cases and need experienced court administrators to ensure cases move expeditiously through the judicial process,” said Greg Chen, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents the nation’s immigration lawyers.\nThe court system has been under immense pressure for years.

Trump has indicated he wants to fill his cabinet and other senior-level positions in his administration.\n \nSome points of commonality are historically typical among senior White House and cabinet officials — Harvard, Yale and Princeton are well represented among his selections’ alma maters, for instance. Other uniting factors are unprecedented: Many on the list have denied or questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election, often a prerequisite for gaining Mr. Trump’s favor. And some \n the \n \n shared by their predecessors.\n \nIndeed, it appears that the most important qualifier in Mr. Trump’s mind has been \n \n \n, which many of his picks have \n in various \n over the past few years.\n \nSee some of the links between more than 60 potential members (in some cases pending confirmation) of the incoming administration, below.\n \nMr. Trump has picked \n to lead key economic departments, raising questions about whether his administration will follow through on promises to boost the working class.\n \nScott Bessent, his choice for treasury secretary, is a hedge fund manager who invested money for George Soros, a liberal philanthropist, for more than a decade. Howard Lutnick, his pick for commerce secretary, is a Wall Street executive. Both Mr. Bessent and Mr. Lutnick have been vocal in their support for Mr. Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on imports, although they may prefer a more targeted approach.\n \nBillionaire entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy \n what Mr. Trump is calling the Department of Government Efficiency. Mr. Trump has said the new initiative \n outside of the government and offer input to federal officials.\n \nThe president-elect has also selected major campaign donors for key positions, including four to lead cabinet agencies: Mr. Lutnick and Mr. Bessent, as well as Chris Wright to lead the Energy Department and Linda McMahon to lead the Education Department. (Ms. McMahon and Mr. Lutnick are also co-chairs of the Trump transition.) As of the last federal filing, their contributions to support Mr. Trump during the 2024 election cycle ranged from $350,000 to $20 million.\n \nJohn Phelan, Mr. Trump’s pick for Navy secretary, and his wife, Amy, donated more than $1 million to Mr. Trump’s joint fund-raising campaign committee.\n \nSteven Witkoff, a billionaire real estate mogul who has \n to Mr. Trump’s political causes over the past decade, was named special envoy to the Middle East. He was on the golf course with Mr. Trump in September during a second assassination attempt.\n \nMr. Musk \n at least $75 million into a new pro-Trump super PAC and \n on Oct. 19 to award one voter $1 million every day through Election Day. The Justice Department warned Mr. Musk that the giveaway might be illegal, but a judge in Philadelphia \n to halt the sweepstakes.\n \nCharles Kushner, Mr. Trump’s pick for ambassador to France, is a real estate executive who gave at least $2 million to support Mr. Trump.\n \nAfter Mr. Trump left the White House, \n of the MAGA movement. Events hosted by right-wing organizations and politicians there largely replaced traditional Palm Beach society galas on the resort’s calendar, as a visit became an essential rite for many Republican candidates.\n \nMany of Mr. Trump’s recent picks were regular fixtures at Mar-a-Lago during this time. Some did more than visit, choosing to host expensive receptions on the property. As Mar-a-Lago’s owner, Mr. Trump is the beneficiary of its profits.\n \n of the proposed \n have \n \n \n or served on the host \n to \n another candidate’s event. Others hosted or co-hosted larger \n for \n they \n or \n.\n \nMr. Trump’s criminal trial in Manhattan was a \n. Several of his recent picks traveled to New York in the spring to show support. Some were there in a professional context. Todd Blanche, Mr. Trump’s choice for deputy attorney general, was one of his trial lawyers, and Susie Wiles, Mr. Trump’s \n, was co-chair of his 2024 presidential campaign.\n \nOthers, \n, Mr. Trump’s pick for interior secretary, attended the trial as spectators and attacked members of the presiding judge’s family on behalf of Mr. Trump, who was under a rule of silence. Both were considered potential running mates at the time.\n \nMr. Trump spent much of the campaign distancing himself from \n, a sprawling initiative spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation that included a “blueprint” document for a new conservative administration that was authored \n by former Trump staffers. But since winning the election, Mr. Trump has \n at least seven people with ties to the controversial conservative policy initiative to serve in his administration.\n \nProject 2025 also includes a database of \n intended to help a Republican president build rank-and-file staff. It remains to be seen to what extent those candidates will be hired in the new administration.\n \nThe America First Policy Institute, which like the Heritage Foundation is a \n, is also heavily represented in his picks so far. At least 11 of the people among his picks have ties to the upstart policy group. Much like Project 2025, the think tank has prepared staffing plans and a policy agenda, and it reportedly has drafted nearly 300 executive orders ready for Mr. Trump’s signature.\n \nSome of Mr. Trump’s appointees are \n to Fox as either hosts, former hosts or contributors. Pete Hegseth was a host on “Fox & Friends” until he became Mr. Trump’s pick for defense secretary. Mr. Hegseth’s co-host was Rachel Campos-Duffy, who is married to Sean Duffy, Mr. Trump’s cabinet pick for transportation secretary. Mr. Duffy also co-hosted a show on Fox Business.\n \nMr. Trump’s choice for ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, hosted a show on Fox for seven years. More recently, Mr. Ramaswamy \n to host a five-part series on Fox Nation.\n \nMany more figures in Mr. Trump’s orbit are frequent guests on Fox News, and several not counted here have contributed digital columns to the Fox News website. Mr. Wright \n in part through his appearances on Fox News.\n \nThe revolving door between lobbying and government is a tradition in Washington — and one of the practices Mr. Trump pledged to eliminate when he said he would “drain the swamp.” But some of the people Mr. Trump has tapped for his administration have deep ties to that very swamp.\n \nMs. Wiles was \n as a lobbyist until early this year. Pam Bondi, Mr. Trump’s choice for attorney general, \n a lobbying firm run by a prominent Florida fund-raiser after she finished her second term as Florida attorney general. Mr. Duffy lobbied for a coalition of airlines in 2020.\n \nSome of Mr. Trump’s selections not shown here have acted as lobbyists without officially registering — another longstanding custom in the nation’s capital. Russell T. Vought, Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the Office of Management and Budget, noted in paperwork for his 2017 Senate confirmation hearing that he had “engaged in grassroots lobbying.”\n \nMore than two dozen of Mr. Trump’s cabinet and other senior-level picks also served in some capacity in his first administration.\n \nSome have been chosen for roles related to their previous jobs. Thomas Homan was the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Mr. Trump’s first term and has been named the border czar, a position that does not require Senate confirmation, for the coming term.\n \nOthers have been tapped for roles less related to their previous positions. Ms. McMahon was the administrator of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019, and she is now Mr. Trump’s choice for education secretary.\n \nSeveral on this list did not have official, full-time jobs during Mr. Trump’s last term, but they were chosen by him to sit on advisory boards. Those people include Mr. Witkoff, Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Musk.\n \nExplore the members of Mr. Trump’s proposed senior staff below.\n Treasury secretary\n National Institutes of Health director\n White House deputy chief of staff\n Deputy attorney general\n Attorney general\nMember of board of trustees of the John F.

Ties to the America First Policy Institute were determined by whether an individual had a listed role on the conservative group’s website or has served as a fellow for the group.\n \nTo determine ties to Fox News, The Times searched for each staff pick on Fox’s website, which lists individuals’ affiliations with Fox News. In instances where a biographical page was not available for a nominee, The Times attempted a further search on the Internet Archive and consulted news articles that described other relationships between the potential nominees and appointees and Fox News. In many cases, nominees had a presence on the Fox News website in the form of submitted opinion articles, but were not described as Fox contributors, so The Times did not classify them as being tied to Fox directly.\n \nAccounts by Times reporters and photographers who covered Mr. Trump’s trial in New York were used to determine whether one of Mr. Trump’s picks attended the trial.\n \nThose labeled billionaires have been referred to as such in other Times coverage.\n \nMajor donors include people who gave at least $250,000 to support Mr. Trump during the 2024 election cycle.\n \nThe Times used congressional lobbying disclosure databases to determine whether an individual is or has ever been a registered lobbyist.\n \nTo determine whether one of Mr. Trump’s picks hosted or co-hosted an event at Mar-a-Lago, The Times used permits from the town of Palm Beach; federal, state and county campaign finance records; tax records; social media posts; and promotional materials from organizations that held events.\n \nThe Times used the official White House archive from the first Trump administration to determine whether people selected for the second administration also served in the first. Some held multiple positions during the course of the administration. In most cases, the chart reflects the last position they held.\n \nJune Kim contributed research."},

Trump has repeatedly claimed that he \n with Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s conservative policy initiative to reshape the federal government. Mr. Trump has said that he has not read its proposals and does not know who is behind it. But Project 2025 has numerous ties to Mr. Trump and his campaign, a New York Times analysis has found.\nThe people behind Project 2025 are no strangers to the former president. The Heritage Foundation’s president, \n, and a co-founder, \n, have each personally met with Mr. Trump. And the analysis of the Project 2025 playbook and its 307 authors and contributors revealed that well over half of them had been in Mr. Trump’s administration or on his campaign or transition teams.\nLarge portions of the “Mandate for Leadership,” the driving document behind Project 2025, were written by longtime Trump loyalists who were advisers to Mr. Trump during his first term.\n \r\n\t\t\tof the 40 authors and editors who worked on the document\r\n\t\t\tserved in the first Trump administration:\nHover or tap to see each person’s name.\n \r\n\t\t\tworked on Mr. Trump’s first presidential transition team:\n \r\n\t\t\tworked both in Mr. Trump’s first administration and on one of his transition or campaign teams:\nOf the 267 additional contributors to the Project 2025 playbook,\r\n\t\t\tat least \n,\r\n\t\t\thighlighted in the list below, also worked in Mr. Trump’s administration or on his campaign or\r\n\t\t\ttransition teams:\nSpokespeople for Project 2025 have \n that they are advocates for any particular candidate, and Project 2025 has no official ties to the Trump campaign. But the president of the Heritage Foundation told The New York Times in an interview in January that he views the foundation’s role as “\n.”\nWhile Mr. Trump has \n Project 2025, there is significant overlap between the playbook and the plans Mr. Trump has articulated in campaign speeches and in his current campaign agenda, \n.\nThe policy playbook, known as the “Mandate for Leadership,” is just one pillar of Project 2025. Another is the group’s efforts to compile \n to staff a new conservative administration. That team is led by John McEntee and James Bacon, who helped during Mr. Trump’s first term to purge the federal government of people deemed disloyal to him.\nThe Heritage Foundation \n since the Reagan era, though it has massively expanded its efforts in this election cycle. To limit the appearance of connection, Mr. Trump’s transition team has been \n from its preparations. (A co-chair of that team, Howard Lutnick, called the Heritage Foundation “radioactive” because of the initiative in \n this month.) But if Mr. Trump were to win the election, it would be unlikely for him to maintain a total ban on those affiliated with Project 2025, given he is personally close to some of its critical players.\nThe New York Times reached out to the Heritage Foundation and the Trump campaign with its findings; neither responded.\nThe “Mandate for Leadership” is composed of 30 chapters, organized into five large sections. Here is a section-by-section breakdown showing some of the ways in which Project 2025’s policies and personnel overlap with Mr. Trump’s.\nThe document’s first section calls for an escalation of executive power and a sweeping overhaul of government personnel. This includes reinstating a Trump executive order known as Schedule F, which would have enabled Mr. Trump to fire tens of thousands of federal workers and replace them with loyalists. Mr. Trump signed the order near the end of his presidency and President Joseph R. Biden Jr. later rescinded it.\n co-wrote the chapter in this section on central personnel agencies. Mr. Kirk was \n, which Mr. Trump has \n in a second term.\nThe Heritage Foundation president, \n, wrote the foreword to the Project 2025 document. Photo evidence shows he took a private flight with Mr. Trump in April of 2022 from Palm Beach, Fla., to a Heritage Foundation conference. There, Mr. Trump gave a keynote address, where he said of Mr. Roberts: “I know what he did and where he came from, and he’s going to be outstanding.”\nMr. Trump’s running mate, Senator JD Vance, \n to Mr. Roberts’s forthcoming book, “Dawn’s Early Light.”\nCircled, clockwise from top left: Kevin Roberts, Rick Dearborn and Russell T. Vought.\nSources: The Washington Post (Roberts); Evan Vucci/Associated Press (Dearborn and Vought)\nIn addition to Mr. Kirk, three other authors of the document’s first section served in Mr. Trump’s administration:\n, who wrote the chapter on the White House office, served as a White House deputy chief of staff and as executive director of Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential transition team. Mr. Trump called him a “great asset to the administration” \n.\n, Mr. Trump’s former budget director, was \n to be the policy director of the committee that develops the Republican Party’s platform.\nProject 2025’s former director, \n, served as chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management in the Trump administration. He and Mr. Kirk co-wrote the chapter on personnel agencies. In recent months, Mr. Dans has \n and \nThe document’s second section covers the Defense, Homeland Security and State Departments, as well as media agencies.\n wrote the chapter on the Homeland Security Department. He served as acting deputy secretary of homeland security in the Trump administration and in another role led legal immigration efforts. In his chapter, Mr. Cuccinelli details aggressive immigration plans, including militarizing the Southern border and completing the border wall, the latter of which was a cornerstone of Mr. Trump’s first campaign. This election cycle, Mr. Trump has promised to lead the biggest deportation operation in American history and to use the military to secure the border.\nCircled, from left: Ken Cuccinelli and Christopher Miller.\nSources: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images; Samuel Corum for The New York Times\n wrote the chapter on the Defense Department. He served in the last months of the Trump administration as the acting defense secretary. As president-elect, Mr. Biden said his transition team \n from Mr. Miller and the Defense Department, which Mr. Miller denied.\nMr. Miller’s chapter mentions reversing policies that currently allow transgender people to serve in the military. Early in his presidency, Mr. Trump announced on Twitter a \n, which Mr. Biden later \n.\nAll of the five other authors in this section have connections to the first Trump administration, including \n, who wrote the chapter on the State Department. She led policy planning in that department and was also a member of Mr. Trump’s transition team in 2016.\nThis section’s 11 chapters call for a significant contraction of many federal agencies and social programs.\nThe chapters call for a repeal of existing protections for L.G.B.T.Q. individuals and demand an end to many diversity, equity and inclusion programs. In many of his rallies, Mr. Trump has said he would “keep men out of women’s sports.” During his presidency, Mr. Trump \n in health care.\nProject 2025 also calls for the federal government to further restrict abortion, including outlawing the abortion pill. Mr. Trump has said he opposes a federal abortion ban and that abortion rights should be decided by the states, though he has been \n.\n wrote the chapter on the Justice Department. Mr. Hamilton, a lawyer who served in the Trump administration, calls for sweeping changes to the Justice Department that would ultimately erode its independence from White House political control.\nMr. Trump has similarly criticized the legitimacy of the department, particularly its investigation into attempts to overturn the 2020 election. He has said he would “completely overhaul” the department and pledged to appoint a special prosecutor to “go after” President Biden and his family.\nProject 2025 additionally calls for the dismantling of the federal Education Department, which Mr. Trump has \n.\nCircled, from left: Ben Carson in 2016 and 2024.\nSource: Todd Heisler/The New York Times\nEight other authors who wrote chapters in this section are connected to Mr. Trump’s administration, including \n, who also served as chief counsel for the Trump transition team in 2016, and \n, who served in Mr. Trump’s cabinet as the secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Department.\nMr. Trump \n that Mr. Carson would be the national faith chairman of his 2024 campaign.\nSeven authors of the section on the economy took on roles in Mr. Trump’s administration or on his 2016 campaign or transition teams. They include prominent advisers such as \n and \n, who \n at the Republican National Convention this year.\nMr. Navarro wrote a chapter in this section about trade. He was the first senior Trump administration official to serve time over efforts to overturn the 2020 election. He had just been released from prison the morning of his convention speech, after completing a \n for defying a subpoena in the Jan. 6 investigation.\nFrom left, circled: Karen Kerrigan and Peter Navarro.\nSources: Evan Vucci/Associated Press; Ken Cedeno/EPA, via Shutterstock\nBoth Project 2025 and Mr. Trump have proposed tax policies that would largely benefit corporations and wealthier Americans. Mr. Trump \n lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 21 percent.\nThe Project 2025 blueprint’s authors also want to reduce the corporate tax rate, but they go further, with a proposal to collapse the tax code into just two brackets — 15 percent and 30 percent — while eliminating deductions, credits and exclusions.

It also leaves vague what it means by the stated goal to “ensure accountability for the previous administration’s weaponization of the Federal government against the American people.”\nThe executive order, titled “ending the weaponization of the federal government,” begins with a list of misleading accusations against the Biden administration for what Mr. Trump has long claimed to be unfair use of the criminal justice system against him, his supporters and conservatives generally.\nThe Biden administration “and allies throughout the country engaged in an unprecedented, third-world weaponization of prosecutorial power to upend the democratic process,” the order continued. \nThe language of the document suggests — but does not explicitly state — that the Trump administration review will examine the actions of local district attorneys or state officials, such as the district attorneys in Manhattan or Fulton County, Ga., or the New York attorney general, all of whom filed cases against President Trump.\nThe presidential order accused the Justice Department of “ruthlessly” prosecuting more than 1,500 individuals for charges related to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot in the halls of Congress."},

During the presidency of Donald J. Trump, who has \n since 1985, the club drew a paying clientele of establishment Republicans and others currying favor with the president.\nBut since Mr. Trump left office in 2021, Mar-a-Lago has transformed into a White House in exile and the nerve center for some of the most extreme elements of the party’s MAGA wing. This includes a nearly steady stream of promoters of conspiracy theories that include lies that the 2020 election was stolen and that the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, was a federal setup.\nThis portrait of the company Mr. Trump keeps was assembled from a New York Times analysis of people and groups that have spent significant time and money at the resort, which has been his primary residence since his presidency ended. See an accounting of more than 130 of those people at the end of this story.\nThe analysis, built on a review of videos, photos and other evidence of attendance at Mar-a-Lago, found that events hosted by ultra-right organizations and political fundraisers now dominate Mar-a-Lago’s calendar, and even officially non-political events can feel like rallies. In this gilded echo chamber, Mr. Trump enjoys unwavering devotion — and collects the staggering price of admission.\nBefore Mr. Trump became president, Mar-a-Lago was a magnet for Palm Beach society, hosting opulent galas from fall through spring that raised funds for some of the nation’s most prestigious charities.\nPolitical events were rare. During the 2014-15 season — the last before Mr. Trump officially entered politics — The Times counted 52 fund-raiser events at Mar-a-Lago. Of them, just one was political: the Republican Party of Palm Beach County’s annual Lincoln Day dinner.\n“Lady in Red” Gala\nRed Cross Gala\nThis past winter, The Times found only six of those events were still being held at Mar-a-Lago — including the G.O.P.’s Lincoln Day event. Traditional charities began peeling away from the club in August 2017, after then-President Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides” of a violent rally to save a Confederate statue in Charlottesville, Va. Of the groups that departed, 10 moved their events to Mar-a-Lago’s chief rival in the Palm Beach banquet business: The Breakers resort.\nGroups aligned with Mr. Trump’s politics have taken their place.\nTurning Point USA, a right-wing student organization, began hosting an annual gala at Mar-a-Lago in 2018. America First Policy Institute, a nonprofit set up in 2021 by former Trump administration officials, has thrown an “America First Gala” at Mar-a-Lago every year since its founding. America’s Future Inc. — a group led by \n that has amplified the false conspiracy theory that a global cabal of pedophiles controls the media and politics — has held two events, as has Border911, founded by Thomas D. Homan, who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the Trump administration.\n“2000 Mules” Premiere\nAmerica First Policy Institute\nBorder911 Gala\n“This is where we come to recharge our batteries and to know we will retake our nation,” Sebastian Gorka, a former White House aide for Mr. Trump, said from the Mar-a-Lago stage in December. Mr. Gorka is the host of a \n “the new front lines in the ongoing Culture War against the Left.”\nThe “Founding Fathers Award” presented to Mr. Trump by the group Moms for America in December.\nEvent organizers, speakers and attendees use their proximity to display loyalty to and admiration for Mr. Trump. They say he is the “\n” (in “\n,” “the \n of America” or “since \n”). They give him awards (“\n,” “\n” and “\n”). They tell him they \n him and sing \n in his \n.\nThe presidential race is not the only one rooted at Mar-a-Lago. A visit to the resort has become an \n. Since 2021, more than 60 Republicans in or running for Congress or state office have spent money at Mar-a-Lago, most on fund-raisers. Their ultimate objective: securing an endorsement or a surprise appearance from Mr. Trump.\nAccording to federal and state campaign finance filings through the first quarter of 2024, more than $4.7 million has been spent on the property by candidates and political committees since Mr. Trump left the White House and made Mar-a-Lago his permanent residence. Mr. Trump’s campaign, and super PACs supporting it, make up about a quarter of that total.\nEach circle represents one political expenditure paid to Mar-a-Lago.\nCircles are scaled by the amount of money spent.\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2012\nThe Republican National Committee\nspent $175,900 in 2022.\nThe Democratic Senatorial\nCampaign Committee spent\n$17,253 at Mar-a-Lago in 2008.\nA political action committee\nsupporting Mr. Trump spent\n$209,481 this past February.\nSome of the biggest payments came\nfrom Mr. Trump’s own political coffers.\nHis campaign spent $423,372 on\nan event in 2016.\nEach circle represents one political expenditure paid to Mar-a-Lago.\nCircles are scaled by the amount of money spent.\n2008\n‘09\n‘10\n‘11\n‘13\n‘14\n‘15\n‘16\n‘17\n‘18\n‘19\n‘20\n‘21\n‘22\n‘23\n‘24\n‘12\nThe Democratic Senatorial\nCampaign Committee spent\n$17,253 at Mar-a-Lago in 2008.\nThe Republican\nNational Committee\nspent $175,900\nin 2022.\nSome of the biggest payments came\nfrom Mr. Trump’s own political coffers.\nHis campaign spent $423,372 on\nan event in 2016.\nEach circle represents one political expenditure\npaid to Mar-a-Lago.

But in reality, that’s largely what Mar-a-Lago had become. More than two dozen midterm candidates had already held fund-raisers on the property when Mr. Trump made that statement.\nAs Mar-a-Lago’s owner, Mr. Trump is the beneficiary of its profits — and the club’s evolution seems to have been good for his bottom line.\nThe Trump Organization is a private business, and, for years, very little was known publicly about the financial health of its clubs, including Mar-a-Lago. But that changed when Letitia James, the New York attorney general, \n for exaggerating the value of his properties. Detailed records of the club’s finances were made public as evidence.\nThose records show that Mar-a-Lago actually lost money in 2012, but then its profits began to climb as Mr. Trump entered politics. They hit a peak in 2017, as the club added new customers — including the \n, which paid for \n and \n — without losing its existing ones, like the charities that rented out the club’s ballrooms for fund-raiser galas.\nA bill showing more than $1,000 in charges for liquor, paid by the U.S. Department of State.\nBut many of those charity customers began to flee Mar-a-Lago during Mr. Trump’s presidency, with operating profits bottoming out at $4.2 million in the Covid-stunted year of 2020, according to an analysis by Laurence Hirsh, a consultant hired by Ms. James.\nSince Mr. Trump left office, however, Mar-a-Lago’s profits have shot up again — even as the club has been in the headlines for its role in both the New York civil case and one of several criminal cases against Mr. Trump. (According to \n, Mr. Trump used \n to store classified documents — often in close proximity to partygoers — that he had illegally removed from the White House. Mr. Trump has \n \n to these charges.)\nRecords entered into evidence in the New York fraud case by an analyst for the Trump Organization, Greg Christovich, showed that Mar-a-Lago had a net profit of $22 million in 2022. The analysis showed that profits at Mr. Trump’s 11 other U.S. clubs — most of them golf clubs he visits far less often than Mar-a-Lago — had also rebounded since their lows in 2020. But Mar-a-Lago still stands out: Its profits were more than double those of any other Trump club, according to Mr. Christovich’s analysis.\n$20 million\nMar-a-Lago\n$15 million\n$10 million\nWest Palm Beach Golf Club\n$5 million\n2020\n2021\n2022\nMar-a-Lago\n$20 million\n$15 million\n$10 million\nWest Palm Beach Golf Club\n$5 million\n2020\n2021\n2022\nSource: Analysis by Greg Christovich entered into evidence in New York civil fraud case\nOne major reason for that increase: Mr. Christovich said that Mar-a-Lago had raised its membership initiation fee to $600,000, the highest it had ever been. The fee, which entitles the club’s \n to use its dining rooms, beach club, tennis courts and other facilities, had been just $100,000 when Mr. Trump won the 2016 election. The club’s new members paid $12 million in initiation fees in 2022, Mr. Christovich’s records showed — money that was effectively all profit for the club.\nAnother reason for the club’s surge: Mar-a-Lago reported $11 million in profits from its food and beverage operations, which appeared to include both the club’s member dining areas and its catering business. Mar-a-Lago has two large ballrooms that host banquets, weddings and private parties. The Trump Organization did not respond to questions about whether the club had raised its rates for banquets, and the turnover among its customers makes it hard to compare the cost of the same events from year to year. But one of the club’s steadiest customers, the Republican Party of Palm Beach County, reported paying more: its Lincoln Day dinner in 2023 cost $318,000, up from $158,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars seven years earlier, campaign finance records show.\n“I believe there was an increase in the cost, steadily, over the years,” said Michael Barnett, who was the chairman of the county G.O.P. until 2023, and who is now an elected county commissioner. But Mr. Barnett said the cost increase had not deterred the party: “You can’t ask for a better venue,” he said. “We would never consider going anywhere else.”\nFrank Vain, a consultant who advises private clubs, said that other clubs in Florida, with no connection to politics, had also seen huge increases in profits over the same period. “We’re calling this a bit of a golden age for private clubs,” he said.\nA recent study by the firm RSM, which serves as a consultant to golf clubs, found that private clubs in the same area as Mar-a-Lago had also sharply raised their initiation fees, though their average fee was still far lower than Mar-a-Lago’s. The average initiation fee in the area increased to $176,000 in 2023 from about $126,000, adjusted for inflation, in 2021.\nOf course, a key distinction sets Mar-a-Lago apart from other clubs a wealthy Palm Beach resident might consider joining. A motivation beyond luxury or privacy motivates the true believers who have flocked to South Ocean Boulevard: MAGA is a movement, and Mar-a-Lago is its epicenter.\nFred Rustmann, a former member of the club who supports Mr. Trump’s policies, said he canceled his membership in 2021 because the clientele had “started to change to people who were kissing his butt all the time,” he said, referring to Mr. Trump. And, unlike when Mr. Trump was president, “he was there a lot,” Mr. Rustmann said. “There was a lot of hand-shaking, and applause, and everybody stands up, and wow-wow-wow. It just wasn’t my kind of thing anymore.”\nSince Mr. Trump left office, and as he has increasingly aligned with the extreme fringe of the Republican Party, photos posted on social media of people and events at Mar-a-Lago reflect that right-wing personalities have become more woven into the tapestry of the club. These are a few of them.\nNote: The Times used publicly available sources to compile lists of events held at Mar-a-Lago, people who attended them and money spent on them. These sources included: permits from the town of Palm Beach; federal, state and county campaign finance records; tax records; social media posts; the Palm Beach Daily News (also known as the “Shiny Sheet”); and promotional materials from organizations that held events. The Times excluded Trump family members and current campaign and legal staff from its analysis of people and some types of events, including business events, from its analysis of events. The total numbers of events, people and money spent are most likely undercounts. Visitors were categorized as advancing misinformation about the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot if they alleged that the event was a plot of the federal government, the “deep state” or far-left activists (sometimes using terms like “fedsurrection,” “inside job,” and “staged”); played down the seriousness of the events of that day; or referred to those arrested as “hostages,” “prisoners,” “detainees,” or similar terms. Visitors were categorized as questioning the results of the 2020 election if they \n, made statements in public or on social media alleging massive fraud or a “stolen” or “rigged” election, or used the hashtag “#stopthesteal.”\nReporting was contributed by Susan Beachy, Molly Cook Escobar, Eric Lipton, Churchill Ndonwie and Julie Tate.

The judge overseeing the case, Amit P.

Trump, in one of his first official acts, issued a sweeping grant of clemency on Monday to all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, issuing pardons to most of the defendants and commuting the sentences of 14 members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers militia, most of whom were convicted of seditious conspiracy.\nMr. Trump’s moves amounted to an extraordinary reversal for rioters accused of both low-level, nonviolent offenses and for those who had assaulted police officers.\nAnd they effectively erased years of efforts by federal investigators to seek accountability for the mob assault on the peaceful transfer of presidential power after Mr. Trump’s loss in the 2020 election. As part of his pardon order, Mr. Trump also directed the Justice Department to dismiss “all pending indictments” that remained against people facing charges for Jan. 6.\nSitting in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said he hoped that many of the defendants could be released from prison as early as tonight.\n“They’ve already been in jail for a long time,” he said. “These people have been destroyed.”\nThe pardons Mr. Trump issued — “full, complete and unconditional,” he wrote — will touch the lives of about 1,000 defendants accused of misdemeanors like disorderly conduct, breaching the Capitol’s restricted grounds and trespassing at the building. Many of these rioters have served only days, weeks or months in prison — if any time at all.\nThe pardons will also wipe the slate clean for violent offenders who went after the police on Jan. 6 with baseball bats, two-by-fours and bear spray and are serving prison terms, in some cases of more than a decade.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump would move on his first day in office to reinstate several executive orders from Mr. Trump’s first term that President Biden had revoked, according to two people in the room who insisted on anonymity to describe the closed-door remarks.\nThe comments by Ms. Wiles, a Florida political strategist who oversaw Mr. Trump’s winning campaign, were some of her first since \n as his chief of staff. She was speaking and answering questions in Las Vegas at a private, biannual meeting of the Rockbridge Network, \n that was co-founded by Vice President-elect JD Vance and that has strong representation from the tech industry.\nIt is common for presidents to immediately issue a series of executive orders upon taking office, and Ms. Wiles did not specify which orders from Mr. Trump’s first term would be reinstated. Some of the actions that Mr. Biden revoked included Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the World Health Organization; his ban on entry to the country from several predominantly Muslim nations; and his exit from the Paris climate accord.\nMs. Wiles emphasized to the group that the window for Mr. Trump to revolutionize government was more like two years, rather than four. So being prepared on Day 1, she said, was critical. It appeared to be an acknowledgment that most presidents face a difficult midterm election cycle after two years in office.\nTransitions are both long and short at the same time, Ms. Wiles said, according to one of the people in the room.\nMs. Wiles was the headliner of the three-day Rockbridge conference. She appeared on Monday before a few hundred donors on a panel alongside some other top Trump campaign aides, including Chris LaCivita, the campaign’s co-manager; Meredith O’Rourke, its fund-raising director; and Tony Fabrizio, the campaign’s top pollster. Other speakers were expected to include Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, according to a copy of the agenda seen by The New York Times.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump’s decisive electoral victory have hit every corner of Washington. But their maximum intensity is felt by the capital’s federal work force, which comprises tens of thousands of mostly anonymous employees not-so-fondly referred to by Mr. Trump as “the deep state.”\nFew notions have consumed the once and future president more than the belief that his executive power has been constrained by a cabal of unelected bureaucrats. In his first rally of the 2024 campaign in Waco, Texas, Mr. Trump framed the bureaucracy as a national adversary, declaring, “Either the deep state destroys America, or we destroy the deep state.”\nHis intention to accomplish the latter is an explicit feature of Mr. Trump’s official to-do list, known as Agenda 47. From numerous interviews conducted with government officials spread across eight federal agencies, the overwhelming consensus is that Mr. Trump and his allies are not bluffing. That said, exactly how his war on the bureaucracy will be waged, and how government workers will respond to it, remain looming questions.\n“There’s definitely anxiety, no question,” said Thomas Yazdgerdi, the president of the American Foreign Service Association, which represents about 17,000 active-duty and retired service members across six federal agencies. He said diplomats were asking him: “Is my job going to be OK? Will they shut down my bureau? What will happen to me?”\nMany longtime federal employees expressed exhaustion at the very prospect of a second go-round with Mr. Trump. “I believe there will be a significant exodus among the one-third of our work force that is eligible to retire,” said Nicole Cantello, a former lawyer for the Environmental Protection Agency speaking on behalf of the agency’s union, which she represents. “Many of them will be unwilling to relive all the hostility they experienced four years ago.”\nBut most federal workers do not have the option to retire or to transfer their expertise to the private sector. Their anxieties about the incoming administration extend well beyond the usual uncertainty about what a new president’s priorities and leadership team will be.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump, “tariff” is the most beautiful word in the dictionary.\nBut to farmers in rural America, the blanket import duties that Mr. Trump wants to enact if elected are a nightmare that they would rather not live through again.\nAs president, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs in 2018 and 2019 on $300 billion of Chinese imports, a punishment he wielded in order to get China to negotiate a trade deal with the United States. His action triggered a trade war between Washington and Beijing, with China slapping retaliatory tariffs on American products. It also shifted more of its soybean purchases to Brazil and Argentina, hurting U.S. soybean farmers who had long relied on the Chinese market.\nWhen Mr. Trump finally announced a limited trade deal in 2019, American farmers were frazzled and subsisting on subsidies that the Trump administration had handed out to keep them afloat.\nNow it could happen all over again.\n“The prospect of additional tariffs doesn't sound good,” said Leslie Bowman, a corn and soybean farmer from Chambersburg, Pa. “The idea of tariffs is to protect U.S. industries, but for the agricultural industry, it’s going to hurt.”\nThe support of farmers in swing states such as Pennsylvania could be pivotal in determining the outcome of Tuesday’s election. Mr. Trump remains popular in rural America, and voters such as Mr. Bowman say they are weighing a variety of factors as they consider whom to vote for.\nMr. Trump has said that if he wins the election he will put tariffs as high as 50 percent on imports from around the world. Tariffs on Chinese imports could be even higher, and some foreign products would face levies upward of 200 percent.

Trump would move on his first day in office to reinstate several executive orders from Mr. Trump’s first term that President Biden had revoked, according to two people in the room who insisted on anonymity to describe the closed-door remarks.\nThe comments by Ms. Wiles, a Florida political strategist who oversaw Mr. Trump’s winning campaign, were some of her first since \n as his chief of staff. She was speaking and answering questions in Las Vegas at a private, biannual meeting of the Rockbridge Network, \n that was co-founded by Vice President-elect JD Vance and that has strong representation from the tech industry.\nIt is common for presidents to immediately issue a series of executive orders upon taking office, and Ms. Wiles did not specify which orders from Mr. Trump’s first term would be reinstated. Some of the actions that Mr. Biden revoked included Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the World Health Organization; his ban on entry to the country from several predominantly Muslim nations; and his exit from the Paris climate accord.\nMs. Wiles emphasized to the group that the window for Mr. Trump to revolutionize government was more like two years, rather than four. So being prepared on Day 1, she said, was critical. It appeared to be an acknowledgment that most presidents face a difficult midterm election cycle after two years in office.\nTransitions are both long and short at the same time, Ms. Wiles said, according to one of the people in the room.\nMs. Wiles was the headliner of the three-day Rockbridge conference. She appeared on Monday before a few hundred donors on a panel alongside some other top Trump campaign aides, including Chris LaCivita, the campaign’s co-manager; Meredith O’Rourke, its fund-raising director; and Tony Fabrizio, the campaign’s top pollster. Other speakers were expected to include Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, according to a copy of the agenda seen by The New York Times.\nThe Rockbridge Network is led by some partners at the venture capital firm 1789 Capital, which invests in the so-called parallel economy — products and companies popular with conservative audiences. Donald Trump Jr. on Sunday evening told the crowd at Rockbridge that he was joining 1789 Capital as a partner, according to two people with knowledge of his remarks.\nThe younger Mr. Trump was asked by Chris Buskirk, the leader of Rockbridge and a co-founder of 1789 Capital, if he had plans to join his father’s administration. He told the crowd that he would instead be joining the firm, whose investments include Tucker Carlson’s media company, the people said.\nMs. Wiles and fellow aides also regaled some donors with stories from the campaign trail. At one point, she was asked how the campaign had responded to the first assassination attempt against Mr. Trump. She told the crowd that the campaign had frequently \n \n by hackers and had encountered \n regarding Mr. Trump’s plane.\nMs. Wiles said Mr. Trump had been more willing to present a softer, relaxed public image than during his previous campaigns, sharing photos of him playing golf or with his grandchildren, according to the other person in the room.\nThe gathering of the Rockbridge Network in Las Vegas was brimming with top Trump aides and donors. The group is likely to emerge as a major power center in Republican politics now that Mr. Vance will occupy the vice presidency.\nRepresentatives for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMs. Wiles also addressed one open question about Mr. Trump, who will be term-limited: Will he continue to hold rallies, despite not running for office anymore? The answer seemed to be yes.\nMs. Wiles, according to the people in the room, said Mr. Trump’s final rally of this campaign, in Grand Rapids, Mich., “wasn’t the last Donald Trump rally, but it was the last Donald Trump campaign rally.”\nThe use of executive orders by presidents has increased in recent years as the country’s polarization has led to a Congress frozen with division and inaction. Faced with little opportunity to change laws, presidents have sought to push the limits of the power of their office.\nBlocked by Republicans in 2013, then-President Barack Obama tried to reshape immigration policy by issuing executive orders to protect so-called Dreamers, who were brought to the United States illegally when they were young children. When Democrats in Congress frustrated Mr. Trump’s agenda, he turned frequently to executive orders, as did Mr. Biden.\nExercising the power of the Oval Office can have immediate results for a president looking to quickly show voters he is taking action. And they can be effective in accelerating a government bureaucracy that otherwise moves slowly to carry out the nation’s laws.\nBut governing by executive power has its limits. By their nature, they are not permanent and can be undone by a successor almost as easily as they were put in place. Mr. Trump unraveled many of Mr. Obama’s executive actions, and Mr. Biden did the same to Mr. Trump’s.\nPresidential proclamations and orders are also more easily subject to attack in the legal system. Many of Mr. Trump’s orders were quickly challenged in court, held up for months or even years by judges who deemed them unlawful efforts to get around the will of Congress.\nMaggie Haberman\n contributed reporting from New York, and \nMichael D. Shear\n from Washington."},

He has spoken often of the experience.\n“From the age of 2, normal life without paralysis was only possible for me because of the miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother’s love.

Stephen K. Bannon, a former strategist for Mr. Trump who was \n last summer, \n and remains free on appeal.\nMr. Navarro, 74, stood to the side of his lawyers’ table, stroking his chin as the verdict was read aloud. Each count carries a maximum of one year in prison and a fine of up to $100,000. A hearing to determine his sentence was scheduled for January.\nSpeaking outside the courthouse afterward, Mr. Navarro repeatedly vowed to appeal his conviction.\n“I am willing to go to prison to settle this issue, I’m willing to do that,” he said. “But I also know that the likelihood of me going to prison is relatively small because we are right on this issue.”\nThe jury’s decision handed a victory to the House committee, which had sought to penalize senior members of the Trump administration who refused to cooperate with one of the chief investigations into the Capitol riot.\nThe trial also amounted to an unusual test of congressional authority. Since the 1970s, \n have rarely resulted in the Justice Department’s bringing charges.

People moved around the plane as the discussion took place, the person said.\nMr. Gaetz’s name first came up on the flight up to Washington. It came up again on the flight home, after Mr. Trump found all of his various options — including a state attorney general from Missouri and two top corporate lawyers — to be lacking, according to two people briefed on the matter.\nMr. Gaetz has been one of Mr. Trump’s most aggressive defenders in public, and worked with Ms. Wiles to help prepare him for the debate with President Biden that knocked Mr. Biden out of the race four weeks later.\nPeople with knowledge of the decision said Mr. Trump appeared to have gained some clarity on what he wanted while he was in Washington, the city he left in 2020 after weeks of his election lies, and where a special counsel was appointed by the Justice Department and ultimately indicted him three times.\nThe statement on Mr. Gaetz was issued from Mr. Trump’s plane — sent not from the Trump transition team by email, as has been the case for all other appointments, but on his own social media platform, Truth Social."},

Among other things, he would:\nMr. Trump’s top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, said that a second Trump administration would seek a tenfold increase in the volume of deportations — to more than a million per year.\nHe plans to reassign federal agents and the National Guard to immigration control. He would also enable the use of federal troops to apprehend migrants.\nThe Trump team plans to use military funds to build “vast holding facilities” to detain immigrants while their deportation cases progress.\nHe plans to revive “safe third country” agreements with Central American countries and expand them to Africa and elsewhere. The aim is to send people seeking asylum to other countries.\nHe plans to suspend the nation’s refugee program and once again bar visitors from mostly Muslim countries, reinstating a version of the travel ban that President Biden revoked in 2021.\nHis administration would declare that children born to undocumented parents were not entitled to citizenship and would cease issuing documents like Social Security cards and passports to them.\nMr. Trump has declared that he would use the powers of the presidency to seek vengeance on his perceived foes. His allies have developed a legal rationale to erase the Justice Department’s independence from the president. Mr. Trump has suggested that he would:\nAs president, Mr. Trump pressed the Justice Department to investigate his foes. If re-elected, he has vowed to appoint a special prosecutor “to go after” Mr. Biden and his family.\nHe has cited the precedent of his own indictments to declare that if he became president again and someone challenged him politically, he could say, “Go down and indict them.”\nKash Patel, a Trump confidant, has threatened to target journalists for prosecution if Mr. Trump returns to power. The campaign later distanced Mr. Trump from the remarks.\nMr. Trump has been more clear about his plans for using U.S. military force closer to home. He has said that he would:\nHe has released a plan to fight Mexican drug cartels with military force. It would violate international law if the United States used armed forces on Mexico’s soil without its consent.\nWhile it’s generally illegal to use the military for domestic law enforcement, the Insurrection Act creates an exception. The Trump team would invoke it to use soldiers as immigration agents.\nHe came close to unleashing the active-duty military on racial justice protests that sometimes descended into riots in 2020 and remains attracted to the idea. Next time, he has said, he will unilaterally send federal forces to bring order to Democratic-run cities. He has also suggested using the military to handle \"the enemy from within,\" whom he described as \"radical left lunatics.\"\nMr. Trump and his associates have a broad goal to alter the balance of power by increasing the president’s authority over every part of the federal government that currently operates independently of the White House. Mr. Trump has said that he will:\nCongress has set up various regulatory agencies to operate independently from the White House. Mr. Trump has vowed to bring them under presidential control, setting up a potential court fight.\nHe has vowed to return to a system under which the president has the power to refuse to spend money that Congress has appropriated for programs the president doesn’t like.\nDuring Mr. Trump’s presidency, he issued an executive order making it easier to fire career officials and replace them with loyalists. Mr. Biden rescinded it, but Mr. Trump has said that he would reissue it in a second term.\nMr. Trump has disparaged the career work force at agencies involved in national security and foreign policy as an evil “deep state” he intends to destroy.\nPolitically appointed lawyers in the first Trump administration sometimes raised objections to White House proposals. Several of his closest advisers are now vetting lawyers seen as more likely to embrace aggressive legal theories about the scope of his power.\nAt the risk of disrupting the economy in hopes of transforming it, Mr. Trump plans to impose new tariffs on most goods manufactured abroad. Economists say his broader agenda – including on trade, deportations and taxes – could cause prices to rise. He has said that he will:\nMr. Trump has said that he plans to impose a tariff on most goods made overseas, floating a figure of 10 percent for a new import tax. On top of raising prices for consumers, such a policy would risk a global trade war that hurts American exporters.\nHe has said that he will “phase out all Chinese imports” of electronics and other essential goods, and impose new rules to stop U.S. companies from making investments in China. The two countries are the largest economies in the world and exchange hundreds of billions of dollars of goods each year.\nHe has vowed to revive his deregulatory agenda and go further in curbing the so-called administrative state – agencies that issue rules for corporations such as limits aimed at keeping the air and water clean and ensuring that food, drugs, cars and consumer products safe, but that can cut into business profits.\nMr. Trump has said he would extend the tax cuts from his 2017 tax law that are set to expire, including for all levels of personal income and for large estates. He also privately told business leaders he wants to further lower the corporate tax rate.\nMr. Trump has long made clear that he sees NATO, the country’s most important military alliance, not as a force multiplier with allies but as a drain on American resources by freeloaders. He has said he will:\nWhile in office, he threatened to withdraw from NATO. On his campaign website, he says he plans to fundamentally re-evaluate NATO’s purpose, fueling anxiety that he could gut or end the alliance.\nHe has claimed that he would end the war in Ukraine in a day.

That motion was denied.\n“The president was advancing an absurdly narrow definition of emoluments that was contrary to government precedent and practice,” said Norman L. Eisen, chairman of the \n and co-counsel for the plaintiffs. “The government has applied the emoluments clauses in very broad fashion for centuries.”\nThe Justice Department \n on Monday to throw out or at least temporarily halt the attorneys general lawsuit.\nBoth lawsuits are historic because the definition of an illegal emolument has never been litigated.

It’s my honor and privilege to be here today at president-elect Trump’s request.\nHe’s asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and \n. As you know, the business empire built by president-elect Trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president. But at that time, no one was so concerned.\nNorman Eisen, former chief White House ethics lawyer for President Obama, and Richard W. Painter, former chief White House ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush\nPresident-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people’s business and not his own. To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will \n.\nWalter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics\nHe further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests.\nAs he said, he’s voluntarily taking this on. \n. The primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have questioned it, is Section 18 USC 208 and it’s simply inapplicable by its terms. And this is not just our interpretation. It’s Congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended Section 18 USC 202 to state that, except as otherwise provided, the terms office and employee in section 208 shall not include the president.\nMr. Painter\nEven so, president-elect \n. He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit. He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law.\nMr. Eisen\nCritical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him. He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H.W. Bush’s Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center.\nMr. Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan. He’s here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric, Don, along with others, take over management of the Trump Organization.\nI’m gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking. First, president-elect Trump’s investments and business assets commonly known as the — as the Trump Organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the \n. Here is just some of the paperwork that’s taking care of those actions.\nMr. Shaub\nSecond, \n, Allen Weisselberg. Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump.\nMr. Shaub\nFurther, at the president-elect’s direction, the trust agreement provides — that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team. The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns.\nPresident-elect Trump as well as Don, Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump Organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency. President-elect Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities.\nFurther, in addition, his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization. As she and Jared move their family to D.C., Ivanka will be focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools.\nThe president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments. As a result, the trust will have two types of assets; first, it will hold liquid assets. Cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and \n.\nMr. Shaub\nSecond, the trust is going to hold his pre-existing illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with. Trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from pre-existing licenses of Trump-Marks Productions and Goods. Things like Trump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, all of his other business assets, 40 Wall Street will all be in the trust.\nThrough instructions in the trust agreement, President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated. This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016. As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for President-elect Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric.\nThe trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. \n.\nMr. Shaub\nNew domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process.\nThe president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and \n. Because any new deal could — and I emphasize could — be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues.\nMr. Shaub\nThe ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts. Again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval.\nTo further reinforce the wall that we are building between President-elect Trump and the Trump Organization, President-elect \n. Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole. There will be no separate business by business accounting.\nMr. Shaub\nAnother step that President-elect Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization: the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency.\nHe has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to President-elect Trump’s role as president of the United States or the office of the presidency.\nIn sum, all of these actions — complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights — will sever President-elect Trump’s presidency from the Trump Organization.\nSome have asked questions. \n Form a blind trust. And I’d like to turn to addressing some of those questions now.\nMr. Shaub\nSelling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest. In fact, it would exacerbate them. The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization’s assets. If President-elect Trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency.\n And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale.\nMr. Shaub\n This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people, and selling the entire Trump Organization isn’t even feasible.\nMr. Shaub\nSome people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children. This would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated. And if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now.\nSome people have suggested that the Trump — that President-elect Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company. Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter. It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization.\nMr. Shaub\nPresident Trump can’t unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized. Further, it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the Trump Organization. The approach that he is taking allows Don and Eric to preserve this great company and its iconic assets. And \n. It creates a complete separation from President-elect Trump — it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on what the trustees can do and requires the assent of any ethics adviser to a new deal.\nMr. Shaub\nI’m going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments. That’s a word I think we’ve all become familiar with and \n.\nMr. Painter\nAnd we’re gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict.\nEmoluments comes from the Constitution. The Constitution says “officials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office.”\n.\nMr. Eisen\nNo one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. Instead, it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument.\nBut since President-elect Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms. They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm’s-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isn’t even aware of.\nThese people are wrong. This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It’s not an emolument.\nThe Constitution does not require president-elect Trump to do anything here. But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires.\nSo, President-elect Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to \n. This way, it is the American people who will profit.\nMr. Eisen\nIn sum, I and president-elect’s (sic) other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach we’ve outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his family.\n and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure.\nMr. Painter\nThe American people were well — well aware of President-elect Trump’s business empire and financial interests when they voted. Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success.\nPresident-elect Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans. Thank you.\nAdditional work by Shan Carter\nAdvertisement"},

Key to the choice was Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, an Army veteran who once served under General McMaster and suggested him to the White House.

Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, to bring in a New York private equity billionaire to run a White House review of the intelligence community — a plan that Mr. Coats and many senior intelligence officials saw as a White House attempt to curtail their independence and reduce the flow of information that contradicts the president’s worldview.\nOnce confirmed — the Senate intelligence committee voted on Thursday to send his nomination to the full Senate — Mr. Coats will face a far trickier political balancing act. He will be overseeing the same intelligence agencies that are examining Russia’s meddling in the election and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow, while also trying to assuage Mr. Trump’s deep distrust of the nation’s spies.\nIt “is an extraordinarily difficult job, particularly in the current environment,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a member of the intelligence committee.

Mr. Flynn previously had denied that he had any substantive conversations with Ambassador Sergey I.

I would be very concerned about any level of lead going into the drinking water or obviously human consumption, but I’ve\n                                        not looked at the scientific research on that.”\nAs the writer \n, the E.P.A. says there is no safe level of\n                                        lead in the bloodstream, though its regulations still allow extremely small amounts of lead in plumbing systems.\nMr. Pruitt’s statement led to a strong reaction online:\n\n                                                I guess working for the fossil fuel industry didn't teach him much about protecting water - or the people who drink it. \n                                                \n \n\n                                                1 in 38 US children have elevated levels of \n. We think that's something \n                                                should \"look at\" \n \n \n\n                                                Shame on \n! High levels of lead exposure cause coma and death but even lower levels affect children’s brain development \n                                                \n \nThere was also a forceful response among the Democratic members of the Senate in the hearing room. Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois asked incredulously, “You are seeking to be the E.P.A. administrator and\n                                        you’ve not looked into the issue of lead in our drinking water supply?” She called that, in the aftermath of \n,\n                                        “a serious oversight on your part.”\nMr. Pruitt responded that the E.P.A. had power to address problems with lead in water and that the agency should have done more in Flint. “The E.P.A. has emergency order authority” to respond to incidents\n                                        of contamination, he said, “and I think the E.P.A. should step into these situations in a very meaningful way.”\nSenator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, had a feisty exchange with Mr. Pruitt over climate change and ethics. Mr. Markey started out by revealing a bit of daylight between the positions of Mr. Trump and\n                                        Mr. Pruitt on climate change. Mr. Markey noted that \n”\nMr. Markey asked whether Mr. Pruitt agreed with the president elect on that point.\n“I do not believe that climate change is a hoax,” Mr. Pruitt replied.\n“O.K., that’s important for the president to hear,” Mr. Markey responded.\nAt her Senate hearing, Nikki R. Haley, the governor of South Carolina and Donald J. Trump's choice for United States ambassador to the United Nations, said she would take an “outsider's\n                                                            look” at the world body.\nGov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, the nominee for United States ambassador to the United Nations, was the subject of rather mild questioning, but that did not mean the hearing was substance-free.\n“I am concerned with your lack of foreign policy experience,” said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland and the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. But he then praised\n                                            Ms. Haley for leading the fight to take down a Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina statehouse property.\nFor her part, Ms. Haley pivoted to an issue of central concern to Republicans, and many Democrats: the United Nations’ relationship with Israel.\n“Any honest assessment also finds an institution that is often at odds with U.S. interests,” Ms. Haley said, noting the body’s 20 resolutions against Israel, more than against Syria, Iran and\n                                            North Korea. “This cannot continue,” she said, also criticizing the United States’ abstention from the latest such resolution against Israel.\n“I will never abstain when the United Nations takes any action that comes in direct conflict with the interests and values of the United States,” she said.\nShe also was asked whether she agreed with sanctions on Russia. “I think that Russia has to have positive actions before we lift any sanctions on Russia.”\nWhat about a Muslim registry? Nope, Ms. Haley said, not going to happen.\nWilbur L. Ross, Donald Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, told a Senate committee, \"I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade.\"\nMr. Ross kicked off his confirmation hearing by taking a tough stance on China, describing the country as \n.\n“They talk much more about free trade than they actually practice,” he said.\nMr. Ross’s stance echoed Mr. Trump’s own hard-line approach. The president-elect rankled many by accepting a congratulatory phone call from the president of Taiwan, challenging the long-acknowledged One China principle and heightening tensions with the country before he even takes office.\nIn an unexpected revelation, Mr. Ross admitted he had unknowingly employed an undocumented household worker, a fact he said he discovered while preparing for his Senate confirmation process.\nMr. Ross said the employee had presented a \n card and a valid driver’s license, both bearing that individual’s name, when hired in 2009. But during a check over the past month, the employee had been unable to provide similar documentation. He fired the employee immediately, he said.\n“We did the best that we thought we could do in order to verify the legality of the employment, and it turned out that was incorrect,” Mr. Ross said.\nDuring that roughly seven-year period, Mr. Ross said he paid all applicable taxes without incident on that employee, using the Social Security number he had been given.\nWe’re interested in your feedback on this page."},

Here are key moments from today:\n■ Representative Tom Price of Georgia, nominated to be health and human services secretary, defended his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company during his time in Congress. “The reality is that everything\n                                that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,” he said.\n■ Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, lamented “the hyper-politicization of the nomination process.”\n■ Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, the nominee for budget director, said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities.\n■ The toughest questions that Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending and appeared to be shocked\n                                when Mr. Mulvaney could not remember those votes.\n■ \n, the former chief\n                                executive of World Wrestling Entertainment and Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the \n, said her entrepreneurial background suited her for the job.\n■ Ms. McMahon assured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations.\nA background investigation of Mr. Price says he understated the value of his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company, \n,\n                                and claimed income tax deductions that he could not substantiate.\nThe findings emerged from a review of Mr. Price’s tax returns and other official documents by committee staff members from both parties.\nIn a questionnaire in December, the committee staff said, Mr. Price understated the value of 400,613 shares of the Australian company that he purchased in August 2016 through “a private placement offering.”\nThe value of the shares was listed on the questionnaire as $50,000 to $100,000, but that reflected the purchase price, the staff reported. At the request of the committee, Mr. Price recalculated the value of his holdings to\n                                reflect their market price. The revised value was $100,000 to $250,000.\nIn addition, the committee staff said, Mr. Price “took improper deductions on his 2016 tax returns” for the depreciation of land associated with condominiums that he owns in Washington and Nashville.\nMoreover, the staff said, Mr. Price and his wife, both physicians, claimed “miscellaneous employment deductions totaling $19,034” for various expenses in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Neither Mr. Price nor his wife\n                                    work as a physician, the staff report said, and “proper documentation could not be located,” so Mr. Price’s tax returns will be amended to remove the $19,034 in deductions.\nSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, questioned Mr. Price over his trades of health care stocks during his time in Congress.\n“It is hard to see this as anything but a conflict of interest and an abuse of position,” Mr. Wyden said.\nIn particular, Mr. Wyden pressed Mr. Price over his investments in Innate Immunotherapeutics, which the senator said could be affected by legislation that comes before Congress.\nMr. Price said he had done nothing wrong.\n“The reality is that everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,” he said.\nJust how involved is Mr. Price as the Trump administration plots how it will replace the Affordable Care Act?\nSenator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, tried to find out.\n“President Trump said he’s working with you on a replacement plan for the A.C.A., which is nearly finished and will be revealed after your confirmation,” Mr. Brown said. “Is that true?”\n“It’s true that he said that, yes,” Mr. Price responded, drawing laughter in the hearing room.\n“Not that he’s ever done this before, but did the president lie?” Mr. Brown asked. He added: “I know we don’t use the word lie here, because we’re polite, when presidents\n                                            say statements that aren’t true. But did he lie to the public about working with you?”\n“I’ve had conversations with the president about health care, yes,” Mr. Price replied.\nSenator Hatch lamented “the hyper-politicization of the nomination process.” He said Democrats’ attacks on Mr. Price’s ethics were “specious and distorted.”\nHe said lawmakers should not “invent new standards for finances, ethics and disclosure that are different from those that have generally applied in the past.”\n“None of those who say they oppose Dr. Price’s nomination seem to be talking about whether he is qualified,” Mr. Hatch said.\nSenator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, also came to Mr. Price’s defense. “I feel like I’ve been asked to be a character witness in a felony trial in the sentencing phase of a conviction,”\n                                            he said. He called Mr. Price “an honorable man.”\nMr. Mulvaney said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities if he were confirmed as Mr. Trump’s budget director.\n“I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later,” Mr. Mulvaney said in prepared remarks to be delivered to the Senate Budget Committee.\n                                            “I also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy.”\nWhile Mr. Mulvaney is a big believer in spending cuts, he made it clear that he wanted to protect America’s social safety nets. “A strong, healthy economy allows us to protect our most vulnerable,”\n                                            he said.\nMr. Mulvaney was asked about his failure to pay nanny taxes in his opening question, and said that it had been an innocent mistake.\n“In 2000, we had triplets. When we came home, we hired someone to help my wife, to help take care of the children,” Mr. Mulvaney said. “In my mind, she was a babysitter.”\nWhat you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address. Please re-enter.\nYou must select a newsletter to subscribe to.\nHe added, “I did not consider her a household employee for purposes of withholding.”\nMr. Mulvaney said he had realized his error when filling out a questionnaire related to his nomination to be Mr. Trump’s budget director. He said that he had quickly notified his accountant, the president\n                                            and his colleagues so that he could correct the mistake.\nThe toughest questions Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came not from a Democrat but from Senator McCain.\nHe asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending, and appeared shocked when he could not remember those votes.\n“Boy, I’ll tell you, I would remember if I voted to cut our defenses the way you did, congressman,” Mr. McCain said. “Maybe you don’t take it with the seriousness that it deserves.”\nMr. McCain was also unimpressed with Mr. Mulvaney’s explanation for wanting to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan. After giving the congressman a history lesson on the roots of the Sept. 11 attacks, he\n                                            offered a final note of disapproval.\n“I am deeply concerned about your lack of support for our military,” he said.\nMr. Mulvaney was forced to address suggestions he had made in the past that Social Security was akin to a Ponzi scheme, and he played down that characterization.\n“I wouldn’t read too much into it, as describing it as a Ponzi scheme,” he said, explaining that he had merely been referring to the fact that the program takes money from people and\n                                                    gives it to other people.\nAs for keeping the program solvent, Mr. Mulvaney said he would not recommend cuts that would cause current retirees to lose benefits. However, he said that he could see raising the age for receiving benefits\n                                                    in the future.\nMs. McMahon reassured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations, promising to work to put in place “the right regulations” to spur economic growth\n                                                    if she is confirmed as head of the Small Business Administration.\nSenator Jim Risch, the Idaho Republican who leads the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said the regulatory structure of government today was “strangling businesses.”\nMs. McMahon presented herself not as the billionaire former chief executive of W.W.E. but instead as an entrepreneur who had weathered the most difficult moments of building a business from the ground up.\n“Small businesses want to feel they can take a risk on expansion or a new hire without fearing onerous new regulations or unexpected taxes, fees and fines that will make such growth unaffordable,”\n                                                        she said. “We want to renew optimism in our economy.”\nMs. McMahon described how she and her husband, Vince, built their global business enterprise from an operation so small they shared a desk. She spoke of how they fought back from an early bankruptcy\n                                                            filing — a stark contrast to the wealthy former executive she is today. The McMahons \n,\n                                                            having given $6 million to a “\n” supporting him last August and September.\nMs. McMahon and Mr. Trump go back decades, bound by their shared background in entertainment. The Trump Plaza in Atlantic City hosted the W.W.E.’s WrestleMania twice in the late 1980s,\n                                                            \n, and Mr. Trump became a frequent attendee at the entertainment empire’s events. In 2007, he shaved Mr. McMahon’s\n                                                                head in the wrestling ring after winning a so-called Battle of the Billionaires wager.\nIntroduced and endorsed by the two Democrats who defeated her in her failed Senate bids in Connecticut — Senators Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy — Ms. McMahon seems likely\n                                                            to sail to confirmation, with the committee expected to approve her next week. The introduction and endorsement of a Republican nominee by two Democratic senators is unusual at the outset of\n                                                            a confirmation hearing.\nMr. Murphy, who defeated Ms. McMahon in 2012, expressed “confidence that she is going to give good, sound counsel to President Trump.”\n“I saw firsthand the fight that Linda brings to any endeavor she takes on,” he said.\nWe’re interested in your feedback on this page."},

Trump offered Rick Perry \n five weeks ago, Mr. Perry gladly accepted, believing he was taking on a role as a global ambassador for the American oil and gas industry that he had long championed in his home state.\nIn the days after, Mr. Perry, the former Texas governor, discovered that he would be no such thing — that in fact, if confirmed by the Senate, he would become the steward of a vast national security complex he knew almost nothing about, caring for the most fearsome weapons on the planet, the United States’ nuclear arsenal.\nTwo-thirds of the agency’s annual $30 billion budget is devoted to maintaining, refurbishing and keeping safe the nation’s nuclear stockpile; thwarting nuclear proliferation; cleaning up and rebuilding an aging constellation of nuclear production facilities; and overseeing national laboratories that are considered the crown jewels of government science.\n“If you asked him on that first day he said yes, he would have said, ‘I want to be an advocate for energy,’” said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who advised Mr. Perry’s 2016 presidential campaign and worked on the Trump transition’s Energy Department team in its early days. “If you asked him now, he’d say, ‘I’m serious about the challenges facing the nuclear complex.’ It’s been a learning curve.”\nMr. Perry, who once called for the elimination of the Energy Department, will begin the confirmation process Thursday with a hearing before the Senate Energy Committee.

Mnuchin, Mr. Trump’s choice for Treasury secretary was far more heated as he came under attack \n.\n■ Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, said Mr. Mnuchin’s work in finance represented the worst in banking practices.\n■ Mr. Mnuchin said he did not use offshore accounts for his investments to avoid taxes, an assertion Democrats challenged aggressively.\n■ Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said he expected a handful of Mr. Trump’s cabinet selections to be confirmed by the Senate on Friday.\nMr. Perry made his case before the Senate Energy Committee that he was qualified to run the agency he vowed to abolish when running for president in 2012.\nThe former Texas governor addressed his awkward history on the issue up front in his testimony.\n“My past statements made over five years ago about abolishing the Department of Energy do not reflect my current thinking,” he said, adding, “In fact, after being briefed on so many of the vital functions\n                                of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination.”\nMr. Perry acknowledged that he had changed his views about the established science of climate change, which, in his 2010 book, “Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America From Washington,” he called a “contrived,\n                                phony mess.”\n“I believe the climate is changing,” Mr. Perry said. “I believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by man-made activity.”\nMr. Perry, perhaps more important, said he had \n, most notably its oversight\n                                of the nation’s nuclear arsenal.\n“This confirmation process has been extremely informative and beneficial for me,” Mr. Perry said, noting his conversations with the current energy secretary, Ernest J. Moniz, a nuclear physicist who played a crucial\n                                role in negotiating the Iran \n                                agreement.\nThe Perry hearing was short on substantive answers to senators’ questions about what Mr. Perry’s priorities would be at the Energy Department, and might be best remembered for an awkward moment. At the beginning\n                                of an exchange with Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, Mr. Franken thanked Mr. Perry for coming to his office to discuss the nomination. He deadpanned, “Did you enjoy meeting me?”\nWith a broad smile, Mr. Perry said he enjoyed the visit. “I hope you are as much fun on that dais as you were on your couch,” he said.\nA startled silence followed as those in the hearing room tried to figure out an interpretation of that comment that did not sound, as they say on the internet, not safe for work. Mr. Franken, who was a comedian and political\n                                satirist before running for the Senate, milked the moment. He shook his head, and Mr. Perry then asked, “May I rephrase that, sir?”\n“Please,” Mr. Franken responded, with perfectly timed pauses. “Please. Please. Oh, my Lord. Oh, my Lord.”\nGetting his feet back under him, Mr. Perry said, “Well, I think we’ve found our ‘\n’ sound bite.”\nThe laughter that had rocked the room subsided, and Mr. Franken said, “Let’s move on,” asking a question about the role of the Energy Department in helping to develop fracking technology and its role in\n                                the shale gas boom.\nIn an opening volley, Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, asked Mr. Perry where he stood on an early move by the Trump transition team to determine who in the Energy Department had responsibilities related to climate\n                                change — an effort resisted by department officials and later disavowed by the incoming administration.\nMr. Perry said that the request for information came before he was nominated, and “I didn’t approve it.”\n“I don’t approve of it,” he said. “I don’t need that information; I don’t want that information. That is not how I manage.”\nWhen she followed up with a question about whether he would protect the department’s scientists and the science budget, he said, “I am going to protect all of the science.”\nSenator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, asked Mr. Perry to comment on \n\n                                \n newspaper describing “dramatic cuts” planned by the Trump transition team that would not only return funding for nuclear physics and advanced computing research to 2008 levels, but would also\n                                    eliminate the Energy Department’s Office of Electricity, its Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the Office of Fossil Energy, which works on technologies like carbon capture and storage that\n                                    reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn an earlier question related to the news report, Mr. Perry had suggested that something might not be true just because it appeared on the internet. In response to Ms. Hirono’s return to the question, he joked, “Maybe\n                                they’ll have the same experience I had and forget they said that.” The line got a laugh, but the question went unanswered.\nOne by one, Mr. Trump’s choices have given their views on climate change. What they have said often differs substantially from their past statements — but is also inconsistent with the current state of science.\nMr. Perry’s newfound appreciation for the science of climate change echoes the statements of other picks for the cabinets, including Scott Pruitt, who in his bid to head the Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday:\n                                “Science tells us that the climate is changing and human activity in some manner impacts that change. The human ability to measure with precision the extent of that impact is subject to continuing debate and dialogue,\n                                as well they should be.”\nSimilarly, Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump’s choice to become secretary of state, said that humans were one of the causes of warming, but that “we cannot predict with precision” where it is going. That\n                                    is consistent with the position he has long taken as the chief executive of Exxon Mobil.\nThe straddling sounds more moderate, but does not reflect the state of the science of climate change — which has grown overwhelmingly conclusive on the role of humans as the prime cause — and it hedges on\n                                    the need for action.\nFor those who remember the Nixon years, this might be called a “nondenial denial:” It moves the nominees from Mr. Trump’s much-criticized statement that climate change was a Chinese-created hoax, a\n                                    comment that he, too, distanced himself from.\nPeter C. Frumhoff, director of science and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the cabinet selections s were engaged in “mischaracterization of scientific uncertainty to avoid accepting the urgency\n                                    of reducing emissions is a dangerous distraction from addressing this serious global threat.”\nSenator Angus King, Jr. of Maine, pressed Mr. Perry on the question of whether cuts will be coming to the Energy department on important areas that include energy research. “Will you commit to me that you are going\n                                    to be lionhearted in this endeavor to protect your agency? Because they are cutting the legs out from under you.”\nMr. Perry began to answer that he had an “interesting background” that involved defending budgets from “those in the know,” when Mr. King interrupted, saying: it is “hard to believe the\n                                    people who recommended these cuts are in ‘any kind of know.’”\n“I’ll allow your statement to stand,” Mr. Perry responded, and then began another of the kind of general statements that have characterized his testimony today. “My point is, I know what the\n                                    Department of Energy should be good at. I have spent enough time making myself aware, both talking to individuals inside the agency, individuals who have been there before — ”\nMr. King cut him off again, citing the limitations on his own time for questions, and said, “I really hope you will be strong in this, and I think you’ve indicated that you will.”\nMr. Mnuchin has broad experience with banking, finance and even the movie industry, but Democrats did their best on Thursday to paint him as incompetent when it comes to running the country’s finances.\nThe pick for Treasury secretary was peppered with questions about how he would keep \n solvent and how he would use the department’s resources to clamp down on the financing of terrorism. Mr. Mnuchin largely kept his answers general and vague on those subjects,\n                                    but promised to work “diligently” to get up to speed in areas that are outside of his expertise.\nHe said he did not use offshore accounts to avoid taxes in the United States, an assertion that several Democrats challenged.\nBefore Mr. Mnuchin had a chance to speak, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, tore into his business résumé and painted him as a symbol of the banking industry’s worst practices.\nMr. Wyden also aggressively questioned Mr. Mnuchin about his view on \n taxes, and Mr. Mnuchin conceded that he needed to give the issue more study.\nDemocrats continue to complain that they are not being given enough time to question cabinet choices.\n\n                                            .\n didn’t want to hear Colleen – an 84-yr-old who might lose her home because of a reverse mortgage scam from Mnuchin’s bank.\n                                            \nMr. Schumer said that he anticipated a small handful of cabinet selections to be confirmed on Friday — just after President-elect Donald J. Trump’s inauguration — but vowed to continue resisting several\n                                    other selections of Mr. Trump indefinitely.\nMr. Schumer said that the two most likely to be confirmed were selections for national security: Gen. John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security; and James N. Mattis, his pick for\n                                    secretary of Defense.\nMr. Schumer said Democrats also “look forward to beginning the debate” immediately for Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the C.I.A., “in hopes that he can also\n                                    receive a quick vote.”\n“It’s possible that some other noncontroversial nominees could be considered relatively quickly,” Mr. Schumer continued, speaking to reporters in the Capitol. “But from there, we intend to have\n                                    a full and rigorous debate on the president-elect’s remaining nominees.”\nWhat you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

A three-year review by the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee unanimously found that \n, pinning blame on Russia and outlining its goals to undercut American democracy, was fundamentally sound and untainted by politics.\n“The I.C.A. reflects strong tradecraft, sound analytical reasoning and proper justification of disagreement in the one analytical line where it occurred,” said Senator \n, Republican of North Carolina and the panel’s chairman. “The committee found no reason to dispute the intelligence community’s conclusions.”\nThe endorsement by Mr. Burr’s committee comes at a key moment for the intelligence agencies. Not only has Mr. Trump moved in recent months to install a loyalist in the top spy position, but Attorney General William P. Barr has also blessed a broad review of possible misconduct by investigators examining the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia, apparently including work by intelligence officials.\nThe federal prosecutor whom Mr. Barr appointed to review the government’s response to \n, John H.

His hearing Wednesday morning will focus\n                                on his strong opposition to the Affordable Care Act.\nMs. DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist, has attracted \n supporting \n and from teachers’ unions.\nHer opening statement said that the public education system in the United States needed to move away from “a one-size-fits-all model of learning,” and toward one that would support parents who chose to send their\n                                children to private or religious schools, or to home school.\n“Too many parents are denied access to the full range of options,” she said. “Choices that many of us — here in this room — have exercised for our own children.”\n“Why, in 2017, are we still questioning parents’ ability to exercise educational choice for their children?” she asked.\nMs. DeVos recalled her own education in a Christian school in Western Michigan, and her mother’s job as a public-school teacher.

The fifth and \n of its report on the inquiry, released on Tuesday, runs for nearly 1,000 pages and is likely to stand as the definitive bipartisan government examination of \n. The report \n about Russian links to the Trump campaign in 2016 and offered broad warnings for future elections.\nA Republican appendix to the report:\n“After more than three years of investigation by this Committee, we can now say with no doubt, there was no collusion.” \nA Democratic appendix:\n“The committee’s bipartisan report unambiguously shows that members of the Trump campaign cooperated with Russian efforts to get Trump elected. … Paul Manafort, while he was chairman of the Trump campaign, was secretly communicating with a Russian intelligence officer with whom he discussed campaign strategy and repeatedly shared internal campaign polling data. … This is what collusion looks like.” \nThe special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, found insufficient evidence to accuse anyone associated with the Trump campaign of engaging in a criminal conspiracy with Russian intelligence officials conducting interference operations. But Mr. Mueller left unanswered the murkier question of what constitutes cooperation or collusion outside the context of a criminal violation. While the Senate report established broad bipartisan agreement about what happened in 2016, Democrats and Republicans could not agree whether those facts added up to collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.\n“On numerous occasions over the course of his time of the Trump Campaign, Manafort sought to secretly share internal campaign information with Kilimnik. … Manafort briefed Kilimnik on sensitive campaign polling data and the campaign’s strategy for beating Hillary Clinton.” \nThe report concluded that \n, a longtime associate of the onetime Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, was a Russian intelligence officer who may have been connected to Russia’s efforts to steal emails from the Democratic National Committee and make them public. The men had a \n. During the campaign, Mr. Manafort had Mr. Kilimnik convey messages to Russian oligarchs and then gave him some of the most important political intelligence that the Trump campaign had, including internal polling data. That would have allowed Russia to understand the Trump campaign’s strategy, where it was focusing resources and which groups it was trying to win over — all valuable information for a foreign adversary about the potential next American administration. \n“Steele’s reputation as a productive F.B.I. confidential human source and [redacted] led to the F.B.I. treating the memos as credible before they were corroborated, and F.B.I.’s vetting process for Steele himself was not sufficiently rigorous or thorough.” \nThe report dwelled extensively on the so-called Steele dossier, a compendium of largely unverified and sometimes salacious rumors about Trump-Russia ties gathered by Christopher Steele, a British former intelligence agent. The F.B.I. used his information as part of a wiretap application. The committee report portrayed the dossier as shoddy and said that F.B.I. officials had an exaggerated understanding of Mr. Steele’s previous assistance to the bureau; a later internal assessment found that Mr. Steele’s previous reporting had been only “minimally corroborated.” The report also argued that the F.B.I. should have done more to raise alarms at a higher level of the Democratic National Committee after initially alerting a lower-level party aide about possible intrusion on its servers by Russian hackers.\n“The committee sought, in a limited way, to understand the Russian government’s collection of such information, not only because of the threat of a potential foreign influence operation, but also to explore the possibility of a misinformation operation targeting the integrity of the U.S. political process.”\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Mr. Trump, she said, was not likely to be hacked because of photographs of the check that subsequently circulated online Friday night.\nBut she said the image of Ms. McEnany flashing Mr. Trump’s personal information in front of cameras sent a concerning message. “This is one of those situations where setting the example is very important,” Ms. Velasquez said. “It’s very important for your average person to understand this is not a best practice.”\nMike Chapple, a teaching professor of information technology at the University of Notre Dame, said the appearance showed why large promotional checks were used for television appearances. “They’re not only a nice prop onstage, but they also omit the sensitive account information that normally appears at the bottom of the check,” he said. “The rest of us should play it safe and keep our account numbers to ourselves.”"},

While the intelligence community has assessed that China opposes Mr. Trump’s re-election, officials said this week that the actions on Facebook so far were small and Beijing had not yet decided to mount a large-scale influence operation comparable to Russian efforts in 2016 and this year.\nFacebook identified a range of fake accounts pushing information about American and Philippine politics and Chinese activity in the South China Sea. Though much of the activity outlined by China was centered on the Philippines, some was more directly relevant to American politics.\nFacebook said it was removing the accounts for violating its policy against “inauthentic behavior.” The activity was coordinated and originated in China, though Chinese officials, including the ambassador to the United States, have denied allegations they are seeking to influence the vote in November.\nFacebook security first detected the new activity and shared the information with U.S. government officials. American technology companies as well as intelligence agencies have shown more willingness this year to release information about foreign influence operations, having been criticized by lawmakers for being too cautious in 2016.\nWhile the Chinese-created network gained more than 133,000 followers, Facebook said it had received little attention in the United States, with fewer than 3,000 U.S.-based accounts following it.

While Republicans praised what they called her commitment to education and to children, Democrats said they were startled\n                                by many of her answers, which they said laid bare the weaknesses of an education secretary pick who has little experience with public schools.\nThey expressed their concern as well about the potential for conflicts of interest in her complex web of financial investments; Ms. DeVos was the first of Mr. Trump’s nominees not to complete an ethics review before\n                                appearing before senators.\nMs. DeVos faced a number of uncomfortable questions, which critics said showed a lack of familiarity with laws protecting students with disabilities and the metrics for assessing student progress. In addition to pointing out\n                                Ms. DeVos’s inexperience in running a large bureaucracy, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, \n                                — the largest provider of \n                                — if neither she nor her children had ever borrowed money for school.\n“So you have no personal experience with college financial aid?” she asked.\nAs demonstrations popped up across the country, thousands of calls and messages flooded the Capitol, many of them urging senators to vote against Ms. DeVos and Mr. Trump’s other nominees.\nIn a move that put Ms. DeVos’s nomination in question, two Republican senators — Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — \n                                that they would not vote to confirm her, citing the concerns of their constituents. “I have serious concerns about a nominee to be secretary of education who has been so involved in one side of the equation, so immersed\n                                in the push for vouchers, that she may be unaware of what actually is successful within the public schools, and also what is broken and how to fix them,” Ms. Murkowski said on the Senate floor.\nBut as most Senate Republicans maintained their support for Ms. DeVos, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, scheduled a rare, early-morning procedural vote on her nomination to press ahead.\nSenator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a former education secretary and chairman of the committee that approved Ms. DeVos in a party-line vote, said she would be “an excellent education secretary.”\n“She’s committed to public education, and there’s no better example of that than her work on the most important reform of public schools in the last 30 years: public charter schools,” Mr. Alexander\n                                said.\nAfter gaveling in at 6:30 a.m. Friday, senators voted to limit further debate, setting the stage for a final confirmation vote this week. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, asked his colleagues to think\n                                about their vote over the weekend. “Sometimes loyalty to a president demands a bit too much,” he said.\nOn Monday, Senate Democrats said they would spend the final 24 hours before Ms. DeVos’s confirmation vote \n                                in a last-ditch effort to woo Republicans to their side.\nBut as the evening wore on, it looked increasingly likely that Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski would be the only Republican defectors, setting up a 50-50 tie. Vice President Mike Pence is expected to break the deadlock on Tuesday\n                                as president of the Senate, offering the 51st vote to confirm Ms. DeVos as education secretary.\nPhoto editing by Tanner Curtis.\nWe’re interested in your feedback on this page."},

Mueller III, has been investigating whether there was collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, few figures seem to have offered more tantalizing leads than Konstantin V. Kilimnik.\nA diminutive, multilingual political operative who was born in Ukraine while it was still part of the Soviet Union, Mr. Kilimnik has continued to attract intense interest from prosecutors for his interactions with his longtime boss and mentor, Paul Manafort, and his suspected ties to Russian intelligence, even as Mr. Mueller prepares \n.\nThe full story of what Mr. Mueller has found about cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election is not known. But Mr. Kilimnik pops up repeatedly as a possible connection, with ties to both sides that are as enigmatic as they are deep.\nAnd his dealings with Mr. Manafort, who in 2016 served as Donald J. Trump’s campaign chairman, encompass two of the most intriguing elements of the special counsel’s inquiry to surface publicly: the sharing of polling data with Mr. Kilimnik, and the work he and Mr. Manafort did on behalf of Kremlin-aligned Ukrainian interests that were pushing plans that could have eased economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and its allies.\nDozens of interviews, court filings and other documents show Mr. Kilimnik to be an operator who moved easily between Russian, Ukrainian and American patrons, playing one off the other while leaving a jumble of conflicting suspicions in his wake. The effort to disentangle the mysteries surrounding him seems likely to leave questions even after the conclusion of the special counsel’s work.\nTo American diplomats in Washington and Kiev, he has been a well-known character for nearly a decade, developing a reputation as a broker of valuable information like the alliances of Ukraine’s oligarchs and the country’s handling of foreign investment and sensitive criminal cases.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump’s advisers knew in advance about Russian election meddling. After tense deliberations between Washington and Canberra, top Australian officials broke with diplomatic protocol and allowed the ambassador, Alexander Downer, to sit for an F.B.I. interview to describe his meeting with the campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos.\nThe agents summarized their highly unusual interview and sent word to Washington on Aug. 2, 2016, two days after the investigation was opened. Their report helped provide the foundation for a case that, a year ago Thursday, became the special counsel investigation. But at the time, a small group of F.B.I. officials knew it by \n: Crossfire Hurricane.\nThe name, a reference to \n “I was born in a crossfire hurricane,” was an apt prediction of a political storm that continues to tear shingles off the bureau. Days after they closed their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, agents began scrutinizing the campaign of her Republican rival. The two cases have become inextricably linked in one of the most consequential periods in the history of the F.B.I.\nThis month, the Justice Department inspector general is expected to release the findings of its lengthy review of the F.B.I.’s conduct in the Clinton case.

The report is the unclassified summary of a highly sensitive assessment from American intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\nThe report described a broad campaign that included covert operations, including cyberactivities and “trolling” on the internet of people who were viewed as opponents of Russia’s effort. While it accused Russian intelligence agencies of obtaining and maintaining “access to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards,” it concluded — as officials have publicly — that there was no evidence of tampering with the tallying of the vote on Nov. 8.\nBut the declassified report contained no information about how the agencies had collected their data or had come to their conclusions. So it is bound to be attacked by skeptics and by partisans of Mr. Trump, who see the review as a political effort to impugn the legitimacy of his election.

She came prepared with a list of things that needed to change to improve the relationship with the president.\nMr. Trump in recent weeks had asked Ms. Nielsen to close the ports of entry along the border and to stop accepting asylum seekers, which Ms. Nielsen found ineffective and inappropriate. While the 30-minute meeting was cordial, Mr. Trump was determined to ask for her resignation. After the meeting, she submitted it.\ntranscript\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”\nToday: The secretary of homeland security was forced out of her job, even after carrying out and defending President Trump’s most restrictive immigration policies. Why that wasn’t enough.\nIt’s Tuesday, April 9.\nCaitlin, describe what happened over the weekend.\nSo on Sunday, Kirstjen Nielsen, who’s the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security — she’s the nation’s highest-ranking immigration officer — she goes to the White House for an unscheduled meeting with President Trump.\nCaitlin Dickerson covers immigration for The Times.\nAnd he, in recent weeks, has been very riled up publicly over an increasing number of people crossing the border, especially families who seek asylum who have legal protections that mean they have to be allowed into the country. So the secretary arrives at her meeting with a list of ideas for how to address this problem, and she thinks she and the president are going to come up with a way forward. But instead, a few hours later, the president sends a tweet announcing that she will be leaving her job.\nBreaking news here on CNN. From the White House, the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, has resigned.\nPresident Trump made the announcement via Twitter.\nIn a tweet, the president said, quote, “Secretary of homeland security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service.”\nSo it appears that the president is swinging the revolving door yet again, trying to install new people in his administration to carry out his bidding.\nThat sounds like a meeting that went very poorly for the secretary.\nClearly, they were not able to come up with a solution that both could agree on.\nAnd by tweeting her resignation, I think what we’re politely suggesting is that he fired her.\nFired her. Yes, exactly.\nSo what is the history between President Trump and Secretary Nielsen?\nSo Secretary Nielsen takes her job at the end of 2017. She’s replacing her former boss, John Kelly, who went to be President Trump’s chief of staff. And she takes on this role as basically the person who has to approve any new policy that’s going to be introduced along the border. And it’s at this period of time when, I think, the President is settling into his role. He’s fired up about really coming up with some hard evidence that he can point to ahead of the midterm elections, for example, and say, look, I’m keeping my campaign promises, and I’m lowering immigration really dramatically. So right away, she’s faced with aggressive ideas for how to prevent people from coming to the United States, and the first one is family separation.\nAnd what do we know about how Nielsen responds to that very controversial policy when it is first introduced to her?\nShe slow-walks it. We reported in December of 2017 that a family separation policy had reached her desk for that final signature, and it took her four months to approve it, during which time she and President Trump clashed quite a bit. She had questions about the legality of it. She had questions about the practicality and how the public was going to respond. And she had just a lot of reservations about moving forward. But ultimately, she agreed, and the policy was introduced in a formal way in April.\nQuit separating the kids! They’re separating the children. Mr. President, don’t you have kids? Don’t you have kids, Mr. President?\nI don’t believe in this. This is not America. This is not our country. This is not what we should be doing.\nThis administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border.\nShame on everybody that separates children and allows them to stay at the other side of the border, fearing death, and allow the secretary to come here and lie.\nCalling me a liar are fighting words. I’m not a liar. We’ve never had a policy for family separation. And let’s be clear — if an American were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States, they would go to jail, and they would be separated from their family. This is not a controversial idea.\nInternally, she’s, if not resisting, she’s certainly questioning and slowing down a lot of these policies. And then, externally, to the public, she’s having to defend them and really look like the face of them, and that ends up being something that she does actually over and over again in her job.\nAnd remind us what ends up happening to the family separation policy.\nSo President Trump stopped the practice himself by signing an executive order.\nI consider it to be a very important executive order. It’s about keeping families together.\nBut it didn’t matter, because a few days later, a federal judge intervened, deemed the practice unconstitutional, and he didn’t stop there. He said that —\nFamilies who have been separated as a result of the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy be reunited within 30 days. The order says kids under 5 must be back with their parents within 14 days from now.\nSo sort of a resounding disavowal of this policy.\nBy the legal system.\nExactly. And so even though she’d pushed back against it, Secretary Nielsen ends up taking the blame.\nSo what’s another example something that she expresses internal qualms about but then goes out and defends publicly?\nSo one of the next policies to be introduced was an idea to limit asylum pretty significantly so that people could only apply if they showed up at a legal port of entry — whereas beforehand, people could and did very often show up anywhere along the border, present themselves to a border agency, ask for protection, and they were ushered into this legal process. The idea was to say, you can’t do that anymore. You have to show up at a specific office, which is, of course, a pretty tall order for somebody who’s coming from Central America with maybe a cell phone, maybe not, not a whole lot of resources. They don’t always know exactly where these offices exist.\nYou do not need to break the law of this country by entering illegally to claim asylum. If you are seeking asylum, go to a port of entry.\nBut as Nielsen pointed out to the president, it was very hard to justify, because immigration law explicitly says that you can request asylum regardless of where you enter.\nSo again, Nielsen is saying inside the White House, hey, this might not be legal. I have reservations about it. But it nevertheless gets implemented. And as you’ve said, she’s the decider. So she signs off on it.\nExactly. And it’s important to point out that when Nielsen pushed back against President Trump, it wasn’t a reflection of her being a liberal on immigration or having a more sympathetic view toward asylum seekers. She just happened to be the face of an entire agency full of people who work in immigration enforcement but who still made clear to her that there were going to be legal and logistical roadblocks to putting these ideas into place.\nAnd what happens to that port of entry policy that would limit the number of locations that people can apply for asylum?\nVery quickly after, it’s blocked by federal courts, and it remains that way.\nA district court ruled that the ban conflicts with immigration law.\nSo this was the executive branch trying to very clearly contradict laws that were approved by the legislative branch.\nAnd now the Supreme Court has refused to step in to unblock the ban.\nSo her legal reservations are well-founded. In other words, her advice to the president is correct, even if it’s ignored.\nThat’s right. Her analysis is sound, because each time she is pushed back, she’s been right. And these ideas have been blocked.\nDo any of these policies that we’re describing — family separation, limiting the locations at which people can seek asylum — do any of them succeed in curbing the flow of migrants, even for the very short period of time that they’re in place before they are legally challenged?\nThey don’t.\nNew numbers show a 400 percent — 4-0-0, that is — 400 percent increase over just last year.\nLast October, we saw a record number of families seek asylum in the United States. This is after family separation is introduced. And every month since then, the numbers have gotten even higher.\nC.B.P. officials say Border Patrol agents are on pace for apprehensions and encounters with more than 100,000 migrants in March.\nSo not only are these policies being blocked in court, for the very short bit of time that they were ever in place, they’re not doing their job of limiting the flow of migrants.\nThey’re not. The numbers keep going up. And some people would argue that maybe the policies weren’t left in place for long enough to show any concrete outcome, and we can’t know that for sure. But what we do know is that these policies that Nielsen was pushing back on, saying they’re not going to work, didn’t work. And the numbers have continued to rise.\nAnd so what does that do to the president’s relationship to Nielsen? She’s in a sense being vindicated, but the problem she’s there to solve is only getting worse.\nShe’s simultaneously sort of being vindicated if you look at it from a legal standpoint, but from a relationship standpoint, she’s the face, in President Trump’s eyes, of these failures.\nKirstjen Nielsen appears to be on shaky ground. That’s according to a New York Times report. Nielsen told colleagues that she was close to resigning Wednesday after being berated by the president in front of the entire cabinet.\nNothing sets him off more than immigration, and I’m told that meeting on Wednesday in the cabinet room was very heated, was incredibly heated. She spoke back to him about it, tried to defend herself.\nSo it’s in this context of the policies that are being introduced being blocked in the courts, the number of people crossing the border rising, and Trump’s relationship with Secretary Nielsen falling apart that he comes up with his most aggressive idea yet.\nAnother day, another threat from President Trump, and today, he is threatening to shut down the southern border.\nWhere he wants to completely seal the border, 100 percent. Not let anybody come into the U.S.\nAnd if they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border. We’ll close it, and we’ll keep it closed for a long time. I’m not playing games.\nAnd how exactly would that work?\nWell, we shouldn’t assume that the president had any particular policy in his mind when he tweeted that he wanted to seal the border. We can assume, though, that he wasn’t talking about, for example, cargo moving back and forth or people with actual visas and permission to come into the United States, but really that he’s talking about shutting down asylum and shutting down the ability of people who don’t previously have permission to come into the United States. And the policy that we know has come closest to achieving that goal, one that’s been kicking around in Washington for some months now, would be to get rid of asylum as we know it. It would no longer allow anyone to apply for asylum in the United States. And instead, people who needed that status or wanted that status would have to stay in their home country, similar to the way that Syrian refugees apply to come to the United States — apply from home, wait many months, go through lots of vetting and background checks, and then only if they’re approved, they would be allowed to come here.\nAnd I guess, what could be a more extreme version of limiting asylum than literally telling people, you cannot come to this country and apply for asylum?\nI don’t think there is a more extreme version, because I think this idea means eliminating asylum. It goes away.\nAnd as best we understand it, what was Secretary Nielsen’s response to this idea?\nFrom what we know, it’s been very similar to the way she reacted to family separation, to that idea to significantly limit asylum to the ports of entry, which is that this is going to be challenged by the courts immediately. It’s going to be a huge lift to get a policy like this introduced, to work out the logistics, and all of it will be for naught, because it’ll be enjoined by the courts. And it’s that oppositional and resistant stance that she’s in when she walks into the White House for her meeting with the president.\nIt’s unclear who threw up their hands first or second, or whether they both did it, but what we know is that the president did not leave her with an option, that he, at least, decided this isn’t going to work. You’re out. And she was by the end of that night.\nAnd so what that means is the homeland security secretary who oversaw some of the most controversial and aggressive immigration policies this country has ever seen — even she wasn’t aggressive enough for President Trump. And so now she’s gone, and he’s looking for a replacement who will go even further.\nWe’ll be right back.\nSo Caitlin, who is the president turning to to replace Nielsen as he looks for somebody to go further than she was willing to go?\nHe’s turning to Kevin McAleenan, who’s currently the head of United States Customs and Border Protection. That’s the agency that oversees both the customs officers who you meet at the airport when you’ve gone on vacation abroad and then the Border Patrol. Those are the police, the boots on the ground along the border. And McAleenan is known as sort of a policy wonk, a really smart and reasonable guy who’s willing to work with Democrats, and somebody who served under President Obama as well. He’s got more than 10 years of experience at the agency. People know him as this reasonable guy. But when you dig a little bit deeper, McAleenan was inspired to get into homeland security work right after 9/11. And at C.B.P., especially most recently when he was overseeing this agency, it really became known as the sort of policy engine with him at the center of it coming up with ways to turn President Trump’s ideas into actual policies that could be carried out. If D.H.S. is this agency run out of Washington that’s overseeing all of this work, it was McAleenan’s staff members that were actually physically taking children away from their parents, that were physically turning asylum seekers away at the border or telling them to go elsewhere or to wait in line. So now he’s moving into this role where he’s got even more power, but I think we can expect that he’ll continue to do what he was doing before, which was take President Trump’s ideas that are sort of extreme and that aren’t necessarily encumbered by the immigration laws, norms, history, and he’ll try to translate them into something that’s practical and that can be introduced on the ground.\nSo even though he might seem moderate at first glance, he’s actually someone who the president trusts to put these more restrictive, maybe even extreme policies into practice. And he’s been involved in doing that already. Now he’s being elevated to do it at an even higher level.\nExactly.\nAnd I guess that all makes sense. If Nielsen is seen as too reluctant to put these policies into practice, then the president would turn to somebody who is willing to do that.\nThat’s right, who is willing to try. But remember that McAleenan is going to run up against the exact same legal framework and logistical challenges that anybody else in that role is going to.\nRight. So if these policies are going to run into legal trouble in the courts, regardless of who is leading the agency, what does it matter, in the end, if the leader of the Department of Homeland Security is gung-ho about the President’s policies or is reluctantly saying yes, as Nielsen was?\nI think you can look at that question a couple of different ways. On one hand, you’re right that it’s not going to make a huge difference who’s sitting in the office at the head of the Homeland Security Department, because no matter what they introduce, if it violates the immigration law, they’re going to wind up in court. But another way of looking at it is family separation only existed as an official sort of policy for what, 45 days under zero tolerance? Not a very long period of time before it had to end. But still, I don’t think that very many people are going to argue that family separation was a small thing or something that didn’t affect very many people. I mean, I think it had a huge impact. So I do think that if you have a hawk running the Homeland Security Department, even when they’re sort of encumbered by the existing legal framework, they can make some pretty big changes, even if, ultimately, those changes wind up in court. I think that Kevin McAleenan has two things going for him in President Trump’s eyes. The first, like we said, is that he knows the policies and he knows the situation on the ground like the back of his hand. And the second thing is that he’s shown a willingness to follow President Trump’s lead, and so he may be the person who’s best positioned to come up with the most legal ways to achieve President Trump’s goals. And even if the policies that he comes up with don’t remain in place in the long term, they might at least exist long enough to give President Trump something to point to and show his supporters when they ask, where are you on these campaign promises? Where are you on this idea of, if not sealing the border, significantly decreasing the number of immigrants coming to the United States?\nSo even if these policies are ultimately blocked by the courts, it feels like it’s important to this president to have someone at the Department of Homeland Security who is willing to try them, and that may be enough.\nI think in President Trump’s heart of hearts, right, he would hope that he would find not only somebody who is willing to try but somebody who is going to succeed. He wants aggressive policies to be instituted in the long term. But I think it’s better in his mind than nothing to have somebody who’s willing to try. And as we know, politically, it’s better than nothing, because then the president can point to these policies that he tried to introduce, if only it wasn’t for the courts who had blocked him, or if only it wasn’t for Congress who blocked him.\nRight. My intention was there. Somebody else is at fault for it not working.\nExactly. He has at least an attempt to meet these campaign promises to point to when voters ask, why haven’t you made a significant change? So I think that having a more aggressive leader in place who’s more willing to introduce these policies, when they get stuck in the courts, it allows Trump to blame the courts rather than his own administration for getting in his way. He can say, look, I tried, but these judges are blocking me, whereas it wasn’t just the judges blocking him with Secretary Nielsen. It was her, too.\nIf Congress is not going to change the law, and I think the assumption is that they are not going to do that anytime soon when it comes to basic immigration law, is the president right to suggest that the current system is broken, and the only way to fix it is to test these new ideas, even if they push the boundaries of the law?\nI would say yes to the first part of your question. Most people agree that the system is broken. But when it comes to fixing the problem, what are you trying to fix? In the president’s mind, the problem is the vast number of people coming here to seek asylum. His idea of a fix would decrease that number. But other people see the problem as not that people are coming here to seek asylum at all but the ways that we’re dealing with them. We don’t have space to place people physically in custody when they enter. We don’t have judges to hear their cases for years and years. So if you see that as the problem, then —\nHe’s not really addressing those.\nHe’s not addressing those problems, and I think that’s because a lot of people who agree with the president are concerned that if we come up with better systems for processing asylum seekers — we make it more organized and efficient and, in some cases, comfortable — that all that will do is encourage more and more people to come. And again, if the numbers themselves are what you see as the problem, then making the system better only makes it worse.\nCaitlin, what does all of this tell us about where President Trump plans to go on immigration?\nI think it shows that President Trump is going to continue full steam ahead to achieve his immigration goals and that if there are people, even informed career officials, who want to stand in the way of that, they’re going to be pushed out, because he’s very committed to the goal of limiting the number of people who come to the border, regardless of the many legal challenges he’s already faced, those that are sure to come, the public reaction, all these other things notwithstanding. We’re not seeing any signs of slowing down. I think this week is actually an indicator of a ramping up of these goals.\nIn other words, the gloves are coming off, even though, in a lot of people’s minds, they thought the gloves were already off.\nThat’s right. It’s like another set of gloves are coming off.\nCaitlin, thank you very much.\nThank you.\nOn Monday, The Times reported that President Trump plans to push out more officials from the Department of Homeland Security, including the department’s general counsel and the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, as he seeks to carry out his harder-line approach to immigration. A few hours later, in the latest legal setback to that approach, a federal judge blocked a Trump administration policy that required those seeking asylum to wait in Mexico rather than in the U.S. while their cases made their way through U.S. immigration court. The judge found that the policy violated federal law.\nHere’s what else you need to know today.\nToday, the United States is continuing to build its maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime. I am announcing our intent to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including its Quds Force, as a foreign terrorist organization in accordance with Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\nOn Monday, the Trump administration said that it was designating a powerful arm of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist organization, the first time that the U.S. has classified part of any country’s government as such a threat.\nWe’re doing it because the Iranian regime’s use of terrorism as a tool of statecraft makes it fundamentally different from any other government.\nThe move was debated at the highest levels of the administration, with top officials at the Defense Department and the C.I.A. opposing the designation, arguing it could justify Iranian attacks against the U.S. and its allies. But the president’s national security adviser, John Bolton, and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, advocated for the decision, arguing the designation would further isolate Iran by discouraging businesses from working with its military.\nThis historic step will deprive the world’s leading state sponsor of terror the financial means to spread misery and death around the world.\nIn response, Iran’s government said it was designating the U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, as a terrorist organization as well.\nThat’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.\nThe move comes just two days after Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly expressed anger at a rise in migrants at the southwestern border, \n to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he wanted the agency to go in a “tougher” direction.\nIn her letter resigning as secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen wrote: “We have taken unprecedented action to protect Americans. We have implemented historic efforts to defend our borders, combat illegal immigration, obstruct the inflow of drugs, and uphold our laws and values.”\nSince President Trump’s inauguration, White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations, one after the other.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Haines, the director of national intelligence. But she added said that Afghanistan is not the top global terrorism threat facing the United States.\n“In terms of the homeland, the threat right now from terrorist groups, we don’t prioritize at the top of the list Afghanistan,” she said. “What we look at is Yemen, Somalia, Syria and Iraq for ISIS. And that’s where we see the greatest threat.”\nYemen is the base for a Qaeda offshoot that has attempted attacks on the United States. Somalia has Al Shabab, a terrorist group which regularly attacks neighboring Kenya. While diminished, the Islamic State still operates in Syria and has mounted attacks in Iraq.\nLong before the Afghanistan withdrawal, Biden administration officials said that parts of the Middle East and Africa were more urgent terrorist threats than Afghanistan, though they made the argument before a swift collapse of the Afghan government. Since the Taliban takeover last month, military officials have said Al Qaeda \n more swiftly than previously estimated.\nIntelligence officials have said the most immediate threat in Afghanistan is from the Islamic State’s affiliate in the country, which conducted the suicide bombing that killed scores of Afghans and 13 American service members on Aug. 26.\nWhile Ms. Haines did not offer any assessment of the groups operating inside Afghanistan, she said a big focus of the agencies she oversees is monitoring “any possible reconstitution of terrorist organizations.”\nSpeaking by videoconference to the annual Intelligence and National Security Summit, Ms. Haines acknowledged that without American troops on the ground the intelligence collection in Afghanistan would be diminished.\n“That is something that we have to prepare for and that we have been preparing for, frankly, quite some time,” she said.\nThe intelligence agencies have been largely silent about how they intend to collect information, though current and former officials have said they will work with Afghans supporters of the United States that remain in the country and will continue to intercept communications.\nOverall, the threat of a foreign-sponsored terrorist attack in the United States has diminished in recent years, she said. But even if they cannot easily conduct attacks from overseas, terrorist groups continue to be able to ideologically inspire homegrown violent extremism, she said.\n“That’s something that we also monitor and counter so that we can really try to reduce the hatred and vitriol, frankly, that terrorism is based on and the tragic consequences that it has for our society,” she said."},

B. 202 - 3 - \nSECTION 2. 68 The General Assembly finds and declares that: 69 (1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in 70 Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter 71 suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud; 72 (2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective 73 signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the political spectrum before 74 and after the 2020 general election; 75 (3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots 76 and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunities to update existing 77 processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence; 78 (4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector 79 confidence in the election system on all sides of the political spectrum, to reduce the 80 burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in 81 Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these 82 goals are achieved; 83 (5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led 84 to significant variations across the state in total number of hours of advance voting, 85 depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday 86 and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday 87 voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramatically increase the total voting 88 hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access 89 to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time; 90 (6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election 91 operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting uniformity in the 92 distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there 93 \n\n21 SB 202/AP \n\nS. B. 202 - 4 - \nis no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the 94 distribution of funds; 95 (7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for 96 voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with long-term problems 97 of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in 98 administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to 99 do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism to address local election 100 problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity; 101 (8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, 102 but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absentee ballot applications 103 in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by 104 electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector 105 confidence while not sacrificing the opportunities for electors to participate in the process; 106 (9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors 107 who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in person. Creating a 108 definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process 109 while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many 110 absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the election were not successfully voted 111 or were returned late; 112 (10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the 113 State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created by rule no longer 114 existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General 115 Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of 116 drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system and providing options in 117 emergency situations; 118 (11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and 119 electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas voters, the run-off 120 \n\n21 SB 202/AP \n\nS. B. 202 - 5 - \nperiod can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden 121 on election officials and on electors; 122 (12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. 123 Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots will promote 124 elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly; 125 (13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many 126 groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting electors from improper 127 interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount 128 importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence; 129 (14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden 130 on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued to rise dramatically 131 from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly 132 reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication 133 will promote elector confidence; 134 (15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for 135 other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a provisional ballot in a 136 precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that 137 they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible; 138 (16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony 139 from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. The General Assembly 140 made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various 141 interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for 142 out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot images; and 143 (17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable 144 under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General Assembly's considered 145 judgment on the changes required to Georgia's election system to make it \"easy to vote and 146 \n\n21 SB 202/AP \n\nS.

Perhaps the closest he came was during the early stages of his presidential campaign.\n        \nRussians reached out to campaign officials with offers of “dirt” on Hillary Clinton and invitations to back-channel meetings. The top military intelligence service in Russia hacked the Democrats while a network of Russian computer specialists use stolen identities, false personas and fake social media accounts and ads to sow discord and undermine the election.\nContacts with\nRussians\nSocial\nmedia fraud\nRussian\nhacking\nMARCH 2016\nMAY\nDenials of\nwrongdoing\nJULY\nfederal\ninvestigation\nstarts later.\nSEPTEMBER\nELECTION DAy 2016\nContacts\nwith\nRussians\nSocial\nmedia fraud\nRussian\nhacking\nMARCH 2016\nDenials of\nwrongdoing\nJULY\nELECTION DAy\n\n          This occurs about two months before the Russian hacking is publicly revealed and is the first of at least two times the Trump campaign is told Russia has “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.\n        \n\n          This revelation provoked the F.B.I. to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign months before the presidential election.\n        \n\n          Both efforts appear to involve Alexander Torshin, a key figure in Mr. Putin’s United Russia party who was instructed to make contact with the Trump campaign. Mr. Torshin met Donald Trump Jr. at a dinner during the N.R.A.'s annual convention a few days later.\n        \n\n          This is the second time a campaign official was told of “dirt” on Clinton.\n        \n\n          Phone records show Trump Jr. called a blocked number before and after calls to Emin.\n        \n\n          This statement comes three hours after Trump Jr. confirms the Trump Tower meeting.

American intelligence agencies concluded that President Vladimir V. Putin personally ordered the campaign to interfere in the election. Questionable transition contacts and accusations of attempts by Mr. Trump to kill the investigation come to light.

Putin against a Russian-flag background, and the unlikely word “Peacemaker” below. It was a daredevil happy birthday to the Russian president, who was turning 64.\nIn November, shortly after Donald J. Trump eked out a victory that Moscow had worked to assist, \n, this time on the Arlington Memorial Bridge in Washington: the face of President Barack Obama and “Goodbye Murderer” in big red letters.\nPolice never identified who had hung the banners, but there were clues. The earliest promoters of the images on Twitter were American-sounding accounts, including @LeroyLovesUSA, later exposed as Russian fakes operated from St. Petersburg to influence American voters.\nThe Kremlin, it appeared, had reached onto United States soil in New York and Washington. The banners may well have been intended as visual victory laps for the most effective foreign interference in an American election in history.\nFor many Americans, the Trump-Russia story as it has been voluminously reported over the past two years is a confusing tangle of unfamiliar names and cyberjargon, further obscured by the shout-fest of partisan politics. What Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in charge of the investigation, may know or may yet discover is still uncertain. President Trump’s Twitter outbursts that it is all a “hoax” and a “witch hunt,” in the face of a mountain of evidence to the contrary, have taken a toll on public comprehension.\nBut to travel back to 2016 and trace the major plotlines of the Russian attack is to underscore what we now know with certainty: The Russians carried out a landmark intervention that will be examined for decades to come. Acting on the personal animus of Mr. Putin, public and private instruments of Russian power moved with daring and skill to harness the currents of American politics. Well-connected Russians worked aggressively to recruit or influence people inside the Trump campaign.\nTo many Americans, the intervention seemed to be a surprise attack, a stealth cyberage Pearl Harbor, carried out by an inexplicably sinister Russia. For Mr. Putin, however, it was long-overdue payback, a justified response to years of “provocations” from the United States.\nAnd there is a plausible case that Mr. Putin succeeded in delivering the presidency to his admirer, Mr. Trump, though it cannot be proved or disproved. In an election with an extraordinarily close margin, the repeated disruption of the Clinton campaign by emails published on WikiLeaks and the anti-Clinton, pro-Trump messages shared with millions of voters by Russia could have made the difference, a possibility Mr. Trump flatly rejects.\nAs Mr. Trump emerged in spring 2016 as the improbable favorite for the Republican nomination, the Russian operation accelerated on three fronts — the hacking and leaking of Democratic documents; massive fraud on Facebook and Twitter; and outreach to Trump campaign associates.\nConsider 10 days in March. On March 15 of that year, Mr. Trump won five primaries, closing in on his party’s nomination, and crowed that he had become “the biggest political story anywhere in the world.” That same day in Moscow, a veteran hacker named Ivan Yermakov, a Russian military intelligence officer working for a secret outfit called Unit 26165, began probing the computer network of the Democratic National Committee. In St. Petersburg, shift workers posted on Facebook and Twitter at a feverish pace, posing as Americans and following instructions to attack Mrs. Clinton.\nOn March 21 in Washington, Mr. Trump announced his foreign policy team, a group of fringe figures whose advocacy of warmer relations with Russia ran counter to Republican orthodoxy. Meanwhile, Unit 26165 was poring over the bounty from a separate attack it had just carried out: 50,000 emails stolen from the Clinton campaign’s chairman.\nOn March 24, one of the members of the Trump foreign policy team, George Papadopoulos, sat in the cafe of an upscale London hotel with a Russian woman who introduced herself as Mr. Putin’s niece and offered to help set up a meeting between the Russian president and Mr. Trump. The woman and the adviser exchanged frequent messages in the weeks that followed. Today, Mr. Padadopoulos is unsure that those messages came from the person he met in the cafe.\nThe Russian intervention was essentially a hijacking — of American companies like Facebook and Twitter; of American citizens’ feelings about immigration and race; of American journalists eager for scoops, however modest; of the naïve, or perhaps not so naïve, ambitions of Mr. Trump’s advisers. The Russian trolls, hackers and agents totaled barely 100, and their task was to steer millions of American voters. They knew it would take a village to sabotage an election.\nRussians or suspected Russian agents — including oligarchs, diplomats, former military officers and shadowy intermediaries — had dozens of contacts during the campaign with Mr. Trump’s associates. They reached out through email, Facebook and Twitter. They sought introductions through trusted business connections of Mr. Trump’s, obscure academic institutions, veterans groups and the National Rifle Association.\nThey met Trump campaign aides in Moscow, London, New York and Louisville, Ky. One claimed the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton; another Russian, the Trump campaign was told, would deliver it. In May and June alone, the Trump campaign fielded at least four invitations to meet with Russian intermediaries or officials.\nIn nearly every case, the Trump aides and associates seemed enthusiastic about their exchanges with the Russians. Over months of such probing, it seems that no one alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the foreign overtures.\nMr. Trump’s position on the Russian contacts has evolved over time: first, that there were none; then, that they did not amount to collusion; next, that in any case collusion was not a crime. That is mere semantics — conspiracy is the technical legal term for abetting the Russians in breaking American laws, such as those \n and \n to a campaign.\nWhether Mr. Trump or any of his associates conspired with the Russians is a central question of the investigation by Mr. Mueller, who has already charged 26 Russians and won convictions or guilty pleas from the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn; the former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, and his deputy, Rick Gates; and from Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, has pleaded guilty in a separate case.\nBut none of the convictions to date involve conspiracy. There remains an alternative explanation to the collusion theory: that the Trump aides, far from certain their candidate would win, were happy to meet the Russians because they thought it might lead to moneymaking deals after the election. “Black Caviar,” read the subject line of an email Mr. Manafort got in July 2016 from his associate in Kiev, Ukraine, hinting at the possibility of new largess from a Russian oligarch with whom they had done business.\nNina L. Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School and the great-granddaughter of the Soviet premier Nikita S. Khrushchev, said that what Russia pulled off, through creativity and sheer luck, would have been the envy of Mr. Putin’s predecessors: puncturing the American sense of superiority and insisting on Russia’s power and place in the world.\n“This operation was to show the Americans — that you bastards are just as screwed up as the rest of us,” Professor Khrushcheva said. “Putin fulfilled the dream of every Soviet leader — to stick it to the United States. I think this will be studied by the K.G.B.’s successors for a very long time.”\nDirect contacts\nwith Russians by\nTrump officials\nJUNE 16, 2015\nTrump announces\ncandidacy\nTime\n2016\nRussian social\nmedia fraud\nRussian\nhacking\nDenials of\nwrongdoing by\nTrump and associates\nMAY 26, 2016\nTrump clinches\nnomination\nNOV. 8, 2016\nTrump wins\nelection\nFederal\ninvestigation of\nRussian meddling\nJAN. 20, 2017\nInauguration\nJANUARY\n2018\nSEPTEMBER\n2018\nContinuing…\nJUNE 2015\nTrump\nannounces\ncandidacy\nDirect contacts\nwith Russians\nTime\nRussian\nsocial media\nfraud\n2016\nRussian\nhacking\nMAY 2016\nTrump clinches\nnomination\nELECTION\nFederal\ninvestigation\nINAUGURATION\nDenials of\nwrongdoing by\nTrump and associates\nJANUARY\n2018\nSEPTEMBER\n2018\nBy The New York Times\nThe first Russian advance party was tiny: two women on a whirlwind American tour. Hitting nine states in three weeks in summer 2014, Anna Bogacheva and Aleksandra Krylova were supposed to “gather intelligence” to help them mimic Americans on Facebook and Twitter. They snapped photos and chatted up strangers from California to New York, on a sort of Russian “Thelma & Louise” road trip for the era of social media.\nEven then, federal prosecutors would later say, the Russian government was thinking about the next United States presidential election — perhaps ahead of most Americans. Ms. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova had been dispatched by their employer, an online propaganda factory in St. Petersburg, to prepare to influence American voters.\nBut why did Mr. Putin care about the election, then more than two years away? He was seething. The United States, in his view, had bullied and interfered with Russia for long enough. It was high time to fight back.\nHis motives were rooted in Russia’s ambivalence toward the West, captured in the history of St. Petersburg, Russia’s spectacular northern city and Mr. Putin’s hometown. Peter the Great, the brutal but westward-looking 18th-century czar, had brought in the best Italian architects to construct Russia’s “window on Europe” in a swamp.\nCzar Peter’s portrait replaced Vladimir Lenin’s in Mr. Putin’s office when he took a job working for the city’s mayor in the early 1990s. Twenty-five years later, the internet offered a different kind of window on the West — a portal that could be used for a virtual invasion.\nMr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, had described the breakup of the Soviet Union as the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century, a remarkable statement from a man whose country experienced revolution, civil war, bloody purges and the deaths of 27 million people in World War II. Like many of his fellow citizens, Mr. Putin was nostalgic for Russia’s lost superpower status. And he resented what he saw as American arrogance.\nThe Russian leader believed the United States had relentlessly sought to undermine Russian sovereignty and his own legitimacy. The United States had backed democratic, anti-Russian forces in the so-called color revolutions on Russia’s borders, in Georgia in 2003 and Ukraine in 2004. It had funded pro-democracy Russian activists through American organizations with \n.\nWith little evidence, Mr. Putin believed this American meddling helped produce street demonstrations in Moscow and other cities in 2011, with crowds complaining of a rigged parliamentary election and chanting, “Putin’s a thief!”\nRequired fields are marked with an asterisk.\nFirst and last preferred, please.\n\n            By clicking the submit button, you agree that you have read, understand and accept the \n in relation to all of the content and other information you send to us ('Your Content').

Russians, she said, “deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted, and that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them.”\nMr. Putin blamed Mrs. Clinton for the turmoil, claiming that when she spoke out, his political enemies \nThe two tangled again the next year when Mr. Putin pushed for a “Eurasian Union” that would in effect compete with the European Union. Mrs. Clinton sharply dismissed the notion, \n to “re-Sovietize the region” and saying the United States would try to block it.\nBy 2013, with his initial hopes for a “reset” of Russian relations dashed, Mr. Obama, like his top diplomat, no longer bothered to be diplomatic. He criticized Russia’s anti-gay legislation, part of Mr. Putin’s effort to become a global champion for conservative values, and gave a \n of the Russian leader: “He’s got that kind of slouch, looking like the bored kid in the back of the classroom.” Mr. Putin was reported to be \n.\nAfter Russian troops seized Crimea and carried out a stealth invasion of Ukraine in 2014, relations grew openly hostile. American support for the new government in Kiev and condemnation of Russian behavior heightened Mr. Putin’s rage at being told what he could do and not do in what he considered his own backyard.\nIf Russia had only a fraction of the United States’ military might and nothing like its economic power, it had honed its abilities in hacking and influence operations through attacks in Eastern Europe. And it could turn these weapons on America to even the score.\nBy making mischief in the 2016 election, Mr. Putin could wreak revenge on his enemy, Mrs. Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee, damaging if not defeating her. He could highlight the polarized state of American democracy, making it a less appealing model for Russians and their neighbors. And he could send a message that Russia would not meekly submit to a domineering America.\nHence the two Russian women who toured the United States in 2014, keyboard warriors granted the unusual privilege of real-world travel, hitting both coasts, Illinois, Louisiana and Texas. At that point, according to a Russian document cited by the special counsel, Mr. Putin’s intentions for 2016 were already explicit: to “spread distrust toward the candidates and the political system in general.”\nIn the intervening two years, Mr. Putin’s ire at America only increased. He blamed the United States for pushing for a full investigation of \n, which would lead to mass suspensions of the country’s Olympic stars. And when the leaked Panama Papers were published in April 2016, revealing that a cellist who was Mr. Putin’s close friend had \n, he \n that it was a smear operation by the United States.\n“Who is behind these provocations?” he asked. “We know that among them are employees of official American institutions.”\nThen something unexpected happened. Of the more than 20 major-party candidates running for the American presidency, only Mr. Trump had repeatedly expressed admiration for Mr. Putin as a “strong” leader and brushed off criticism of Russia. Only he had little interest in the traditional American preoccupation with democracy and human rights. Only he had explored business interests in Russia for years, repeatedly pursuing a Trump Tower project in Moscow and bringing his beauty pageant there in 2013.\n“Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow,” the future candidate tweeted at the time, adding wistfully, “if so, will he become my new best friend?”\nIf Mr. Putin had been designing his ideal leader for the United States, he could hardly have done better than Donald Trump.\nFor some years, Mr. Trump had attracted attention from Russian conservatives with Kremlin ties. A Putin ally named Konstantin Rykov had begun promoting Mr. Trump as a future president in 2012 and created a \n three years later to support his candidacy. A Russian think tank, \n, had begun running analyses pushing Mr. Trump.\nMr. Trump as a candidate was “tough, rough, says what he thinks, rude, emotional and, apparently, candid,” \n c\n Mr. Dugin declared that Mr. Trump probably had “no chance of winning” against the “quite annoying” Mrs. Clinton, but added a postscript: “We want to put trust in Donald Trump. Vote for Trump, and see what will happen.”\nAgainst all expectations, Republicans across the country began to do just that, and soon Mr. Trump was beating the crowd of mainstream Republicans. Mr. Putin, said Yuval Weber, \n “found for the first time since the collapse of the U.S.S.R. that he has a prospective president of the United States who fundamentally views international issues from the Russian point of view.”\nAsked about the surging Mr. Trump in December 2015, \n he was “a talent, without any doubt,” and “absolutely the leader in the presidential race.” He also applied to the candidate the Russian word \n, which means “colorful” or “flamboyant” but which some reports mistranslated as “brilliant,” an assessment that Mr. Trump immediately began repeating.\n“It’s always a great honor to be so nicely complimented,” Mr. Trump said, “by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond.”\nMr. Trump had steamrollered his primary opponents in part by taking aim at Republican foreign policy orthodoxy. The post-9/11 wars were foolish and costly, he would often say at campaign events. America’s allies were deadbeats and freeloaders, he told supporters, who cheered in agreement. Russia was not an existential threat, he said, but a potential ally in beating back terrorist groups.\nIn early March 2016, the establishment struck back. In \n, dozens of the party’s national security luminaries vowed publicly to try to stop the election of a candidate “so utterly unfitted to the office.”\nThey took particular umbrage at Mr. Trump’s remarks about the Russian president, writing that his “admiration for foreign dictators such as Vladimir Putin is unacceptable for the leader of the world’s greatest democracy.”\nBut Mr. Trump was not cowed. He soon signed on new advisers and aides, including some who had been pushed to the fringe of a political party that had long lionized President Ronald Reagan for staring down Soviet leaders at the height of the Cold War.\nTo the Kremlin, they must have looked like a dream team.\nMr. Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, had long viewed Russia as a natural ally in what he saw as a “world war” against radical Islam. In June 2013, when he was D.I.A. chief, he sat inside the imposing headquarters of the G.R.U., Russia’s military intelligence agency, and chatted with officers. Two years later, he sat at Mr. Putin’s elbow at a gala dinner in Moscow.\nMr. Manafort, a longtime Republican lobbyist, had earned millions working for a pro-Kremlin leader in Ukraine and had a history of business dealings with Oleg Deripaska, a Russian aluminum magnate close to Mr. Putin. He was nearly broke when he joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 — hired to help prevent a mass defection of convention delegates — and yet he offered to work on the campaign unpaid.\nCarter Page, a businessman who spent several years working in Moscow, was virtually unknown in Washington when Mr. Trump appointed him a foreign policy adviser. But the S.V.R., Russia’s foreign intelligence service, knew who he was.\nIn 2013, Mr. Page met in New York with a Russian spy posing as an attaché at the United Nations and passed along energy industry documents in hopes of securing lucrative deals in Moscow.\nThe F.B.I., which had been tracking Russian spies when Mr. Page came on the bureau’s radar, determined that he had no idea he was meeting with a Russian agent.\n“I promised him a lot,” \n, Victor Podobnyy, speaking to another Russian intelligence officer about his dealings with Mr. Page, according to an F.B.I. transcript. “How else to work with foreigners? You promise a favor for a favor.”\nThe new team was in place by the end of March, and Mr. Trump had a new message that was strikingly similar to one of Mr. Putin’s most ardent talking points.\n“I think NATO’s obsolete,” Mr. Trump said \n on ABC’s “This Week.”\n“NATO’s not meant for terrorism,” he went on to say. “NATO doesn’t have the right countries in it for terrorism.”\nBy then, the Russian intelligence operation to intervene in the American election — including efforts to infiltrate and influence the Trump campaign — had begun.\nMr. Papadopoulos, the 28-year-old campaign adviser, did not know this when he met in the cafe of the London hotel with Mr. Putin’s “niece” (he has no niece) and an obscure Maltese professor in late March. The academic had taken an interest in Mr. Papadopoulos when he joined the campaign.\nF.B.I. agents have identified the professor, Joseph Mifsud, as a likely cutout for Russian intelligence, sent to establish contact with Mr. Papadopoulos and possibly get information about the direction of the Trump campaign. He disappeared after his name surfaced last October, and his whereabouts is unknown. At one point he changed his WhatsApp status to a simple, if cryptic, message: “Alive.”\nProfessor Mifsud arranged an email introduction between Mr. Papadopoulos and a Russian foreign ministry official. The American also exchanged emails with Olga Polonskaya, the woman in the cafe. “We are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,” she wrote in one message, and the two discussed a possible meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump.\nOver time, though, Mr. Papadopoulos came to question whether the messages were actually from Ms. Polonskaya. The woman he had met in the cafe barely spoke English. The emails he received were in nearly perfect English.\n“I even remember sending her a message asking if I’m speaking to the same person I met in London because the conversations were so strange,” he said during an interview this month.\nIn late April, Mr. Trump gave his first major foreign policy address in the ballroom of a historic Washington hotel. Some of the speech was a familiar litany of Republican policy positions — hawkish warnings to Iran and pledges to be tough on terrorism. But midway through the speech, as Russia’s ambassador to the United States watched from the front seats, Mr. Trump pivoted and said the United States and Russia should look for areas of mutual interest.\n“Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility, must end, and ideally will end soon,” he said.\n“That’s the signal to meet,” Mr. Papadopoulos wrote in an email to his Russian foreign ministry contact that evening, meaning that Mr. Trump’s favorable comments about Russia suggested he might be interested in meeting Mr. Putin.\nJust one day earlier, Professor Mifsud had told the campaign aide about a possible gift from Moscow: thousands of hacked emails that might damage Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy.\nIt was a breathtaking revelation. But there was no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos — while ambitious and eager for advancement in the bare-bones campaign — passed the information along to anyone inside the Trump circle.\nMore than two years later, Mr. Papadopoulos says he has “no recollection” of telling anyone in the campaign about the emails. He said he was supposed to have a phone call that day with Stephen Miller, a top campaign adviser, but it was postponed. If the two men had talked, Mr. Papadopoulos said, he might have shared the information.\n“How fate works sometimes, I guess,” said Mr. Papadopoulos, who has been sentenced to 14 days in jail for lying to the F.B.I.\nAs Mr. Trump continued to win primaries and vacuum up convention delegates late in the spring, the Russians made multiple attempts to establish contact with campaign officials.\nA Republican operative connected to the N.R.A. tried to arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and a Russian central banker at an N.R.A. convention in Kentucky in May. “Putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,” wrote the operative, Paul Erickson, in an email with the subject “Kremlin connection.” “Ever since Hillary compared Putin to Hitler, all senior Russian leaders consider her beyond redemption.”\nMr. Page, the foreign policy adviser, was invited to deliver the commencement address at the prestigious New Economic School in Moscow. That invitation now appears to have been an effort both to gain information about the Trump campaign and to influence it by feting Mr. Page in the Russian capital. Russian television that year was describing him as a “famous American economist,” but he was an obscure figure in this country.\nAt that time, the last American to give the commencement speech was Mr. Obama, who used the opportunity to criticize Russia for its treatment of Georgia and Ukraine.\nMr. Page, though, criticized the “hypocrisy” of the United States and its NATO allies for lecturing Russia about bullying its neighbors, which were former Soviet republics, while the Westerners were taking “proactive steps to encourage regime change overseas.” During his time in Moscow, Mr. Page met with at least one top Russian official and numerous business leaders.\nAnd there was the now infamous June 2016 approach to Donald Trump Jr. by Russians whom he and his father had known from their days taking the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow. The Russians met at Trump Tower in Manhattan with top campaign officials after promising damaging information on Mrs. Clinton.\nWhat exactly transpired during the meeting is still a mystery, but it appears that the Russians pulled a bait-and-switch. They used the session to push for an end to the crippling economic sanctions that Mr. Obama had imposed on Russia.\nDonald Trump Jr. has said how disappointed he and other campaign advisers were that they didn’t get what the Russians had promised. The campaign’s reaction to the Russian attempts to discredit Mrs. Clinton’s campaign was not to rebuff them or call law enforcement — it was to try to exploit them.\nExperts who have studied Russian operations for decades see the catalog of contacts and communications between Russians and Mr. Trump’s advisers as a loosely coordinated effort by Russian intelligence both to get insight into the campaign and to influence it.\n“The Russians aren’t reckless, and I don’t see them going through with this effort without thinking they had a willing partner in the dance,” said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former C.I.A. officer who served as the spy agency’s station chief in Moscow.\nBy midsummer 2016, the Russian contacts sounded alarms inside the F.B.I., where agents had received a tip about Mr. Papadopoulos and puzzled over Mr. Page’s Moscow visit. The bureau sent a trusted informant to help understand what was happening: Stefan Halper, a former Nixon and Reagan adviser and professor at Cambridge University, reached out to Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos under false pretenses.\nAmerican officials have defended Professor Halper’s work, saying the use of such a confidential informant is routine in a counterintelligence investigation. Mr. Trump and his allies in Congress and the media have called him something different: a “spy” sent by the Obama administration to infiltrate the campaign.\nEventually, Mr. Trump would use such episodes as a foundation for his view that America’s law enforcement agencies had been aligned against him from the beginning — ammunition for a looming war with the “deep state.” This idea would consume Mr. Trump after he became president, feeding his sense of grievance that the legitimacy of his victory was under attack and shaping his decisions as he tried to blunt the widening Russia investigation.\nThe long-promised “dirt” the Russians had on Mrs. Clinton would soon be made public. Three days after the Trump Tower meeting, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, appeared on a British Sunday television show.\nHe said that his website would soon be publishing a raft of emails related to Mrs. Clinton. And he said something at once ominous and prescient: “WikiLeaks has a very big year ahead.”\nA website made its splashy debut three days later, presenting a jaunty hacker who called himself Guccifer 2.0. He had broken into the Democratic National Committee’s computer network, Guccifer said, offering as proof a selection of purloined documents.\n“Here are just a few docs from many thousands I extracted when hacking into the DNC’s network,” Guccifer wrote on June 15. “The main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks,” he added — which seemed to explain Mr. Assange’s boast.\nRussian intelligence had worked fast. Just the day before, D.N.C. officials and their cybersecurity contractor, CrowdStrike, had announced that Russian hackers had penetrated the committee’s computer network.\nOvernight, Russian military intelligence officers set up the website and created the Guccifer persona to counter the D.N.C. accusations. Guccifer — a name borrowed from a real Romanian hacker — was presented as a jovial Romanian, a “lone hacker,” who in his posts wanted to make one thing very clear: He had nothing whatsoever to do with Russia.\n“It seems the guys from CrowdStrike and the DNC,” \n, “would say I’m a Russian bear even if I were a catholic nun.”\nIn fact, beyond the conclusions of CrowdStrike and the F.B.I., there were \n Guccifer’s posts came from Moscow: The name of the founder of the Soviet secret police was embedded in Guccifer’s documents, written using a Russian version of Microsoft Word.\nYet the Guccifer gambit would prove remarkably effective at creating doubt about Russia’s responsibility for the hack. Republican operatives working on congressional campaigns emailed “Guccifer” and received hacked documents relevant to their races. For journalists, the claims of the supposed “lone hacker” made the role of Russian intelligence seem to be a disputed allegation rather than a proven fact.\nToday there is no doubt who hacked the D.N.C. and the Clinton campaign. A \n of 12 officers of Russia’s military intelligence agency, filed in July by Mr. Mueller, documents their every move, including their break-in techniques, their tricks to hide inside the Democrats’ networks and even their Google searches.\nThe agency, now called the Main Directorate but often referred to by its former abbreviation, the G.R.U., proved agile, brazen and not terribly discreet — the same pattern it would show two years later in the nerve-agent poisoning in England of its former officer, the defector Sergei V. Skripal.\nThe hacking might have drawn little attention had the G.R.U. stopped there, simply stealing emails to peruse for intelligence clues. But the Russians’ decision to leak the emails to undercut Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy was a huge escalation.\nThe Russian officers’ political skills proved equal to their hacking expertise. They deftly manipulated a long list of Americans and Europeans, many of whom embraced Guccifer’s tall tale and took seriously the claim that the other Russian false front, DCLeaks.com, was run by American “hacktivists.”\n“Guccifer 2.0” \n in London via messages to one of the organizers. The purported Romanian \n with a suspicious reporter for Motherboard, insisting: “I don’t like Russians and their foreign policy. I hate being attributed to Russia.” When Twitter suspended the DCLeaks account, the Fox Business host Lou Dobbs \n of “Leftist Fascism.” The account was swiftly reinstated.\nBut the Russians’ masterstroke was to enlist, via the Guccifer persona, the help of WikiLeaks. Neither of the Russians’ websites, Guccifer 2.0 or DCLeaks.com, had much reach. But WikiLeaks had a large global audience. Its editor, Mr. Assange, shared Mr. Putin’s hatred of Mrs. Clinton and had a soft spot for Russia.\nMr. Assange assisted with the subterfuge. He repeatedly denied that he’d received the documents from Russia; whether he was really taken in by the “Guccifer” ruse is uncertain.\nBut he also obscured the Russian role by fueling a right-wing conspiracy theory he knew to be false. He \n for information about the murder in Washington of Seth Rich, a young D.N.C. staffer shot to death in an apparent bungled street robbery. Trump supporters were suggesting Mr. Rich had leaked the D.N.C. emails and been killed in retaliation, and Mr. Assange played along.\nIn \n in August 2016, Mr. Assange suddenly brought up Mr. Rich’s killing.\n“That was just a robbery, I believe, wasn’t it?” the interviewer said. “What are you suggesting?”\n“I’m suggesting that our sources take risks,” Mr. Assange said — and then declined to say if Mr. Rich was a source.\nSuch misleading interviews helped camouflage the Russian origin of the leak, and WikiLeaks’ adept timing gave the emails big impact. After some technical problems, according to Mr. \n, “Guccifer” passed the entire archive of D.N.C. emails to WikiLeaks. The website published 19,252 of them on July 22, 2016 — three days before the Democratic National Convention.\nThe Russians’ work detonated with powerful political effect. The emails’ exposure of D.N.C. staffers’ support for Mrs. Clinton and scorn for Senator Bernie Sanders, her chief rival, \n. The resentment of the Sanders delegates deepened, \n as it turned to the general election.\nUnknown to the feuding Democratic delegates, a cyberdrama had been playing out in secret for weeks, as CrowdStrike experts tried to root out the Russian hackers who had penetrated the D.N.C. and its sister organization, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\nRobert S. Johnston, a lead investigator for CrowdStrike, said the Russian hackers, uniformed officers of military intelligence, were “like a thunderstorm moving through the system — very, very noisy.”\nCrowdStrike had begun watching the Russians in April, asking D.N.C. staffers to keep quiet about the intrusion. “We only talked over Signal,” an encrypted text and call service, said Mr. Johnston, a former Marine and veteran of the United States Cyber Command who is now chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Adlumin. Only by following the hackers for several weeks could CrowdStrike be certain it had found the Russians’ tools and blocked their access.\nBut somehow, possibly by intercepting communications inside the D.N.C. or the F.B.I., which was investigating the breach, the G.R.U. officers learned they had been spotted. On May 31, two weeks before the public disclosure of the hack, Ivan Yermakov, a G.R.U. hacker who had used American-sounding online personas — “Kate S. Milton,” “James McMorgans” and “Karen W. Millen” — suddenly began searching online for information about CrowdStrike. He sought to find out what the cybersleuths knew about the Russians’ main tool, a nasty piece of malware called X-Agent, the indictment noted.\nAfter that, the spy-versus-spy contest escalated. “We knew it was the Russians, and they knew we knew,” Mr. Johnston said. “I would say it was the cyber equivalent of hand-to-hand combat.”\nThe candidate favored by the Russians alternated between denying their help and seeming to welcome it. On June 15, the day after the D.N.C. hack was disclosed, the Trump campaign pitched in with a novel idea to deflect blame from the Russians: The D.N.C. had somehow hacked itself.\n“We believe it was the D.N.C. that did the ‘hacking’ as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate,” \n. Later, Mr. Trump tried out other alternative theories: Perhaps the hack had been carried out by “somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds,” or a “some guy in his home in New Jersey,” or the Chinese, or almost anyone.\nBut at other times, he appeared to accept that Russia was responsible.\n“The new joke in town,” Mr. Trump tweeted on July 25, “is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC emails, which should have never been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.”\nAnd two days later, he famously \n to try to retrieve 30,000 emails that Mrs. Clinton had deleted from her computer server on the basis that they involved personal matters and not State Department business.\n“Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” Mr. Trump said during a Florida news conference. The Mueller investigation discovered that \n: The same day as the news conference, the G.R.U. hackers began sending so-called spearphishing emails to accounts associated with Mrs. Clinton’s personal office.\nMr. Trump’s pronouncements stood in striking contrast to the responses of past presidential candidates who had been offered assistance by foreign powers. In 1960, both \n and \n refused quiet offers of help from Khrushchev.\n“Because we know the ideas of Mr. Stevenson, we in our hearts all favor him,” Khrushchev said in a message passed on by the Soviet ambassador. “Could the Soviet press assist Mr. Stevenson’s personal success? How?”\nMr. Stevenson declined the offer, in language that reflected the broad American political consensus about foreign election interference. “I believe I made it clear to him,” Mr. Stevenson wrote, “that I considered the offer of such assistance highly improper, indiscreet and dangerous to all concerned.”\nRussia did not deliver on Mr. Trump’s request for Mrs. Clinton’s deleted emails. But it had obtained something just as useful: 50,000 emails of John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, stolen via a phishing attack by the G.R.U. Roger Stone, a political operative and longtime Trump friend, seemed to have advance word. “Trust me,” he wrote on Twitter on Aug. 25, it would soon be “Podesta’s time in the barrel.”\nBut WikiLeaks withheld the Podesta emails for months after receiving them from “Guccifer” in June, evidently waiting for the right moment to have the biggest impact on the race. The time came on Oct. 7, amid two blows to the Trump campaign.\nThat day, American intelligence agencies made their first \n that the Russian government, with the approval of its “senior-most officials,” was behind the hacking and leaking of the Democratic emails.\nAnd then came a potentially lethal disclosure for the Trump campaign: the shocking “Access Hollywood” recording in which Mr. Trump bragged of groping and sexually assaulting women. The candidate desperately needed to change the subject — and that was the moment WikiLeaks posted the first of thousands of Mr. Podesta’s emails.\nThey were invaluable for political journalists, offering embarrassing comments from staffers about Mrs. Clinton’s shortcomings and the full texts of her highly paid speeches to banks and corporations, which she had refused to release. WikiLeaks assisted by highlighting interesting tidbits in yellow.\nSoon, Mr. Trump was delighting his supporters by reading from the stolen emails on the campaign trail. “Now, this just came out,”\n in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., in October, brandishing a page of highlights. “WikiLeaks! I love WikiLeaks!”\n“Crooked Hillary” had said “behind closed doors,” Mr. Trump declared, that terrorism was “not a threat”; that she had “a great relationship with the financial industry”; that ISIS might infiltrate groups of refugees coming to the United States; that a politician needed to have “both a public and private position” on policies; and on and on.\nThe quotes were taken out of context, of course, and subjected to the most damaging interpretation. But they seemed to offer a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton’s hidden views.\nFor the last month of the campaign, in daily releases that kept the Clinton team on the defensive, WikiLeaks delivered the Russians’ gift. If the July D.N.C. dump had been an explosion, the October series was more like unrelenting sniper fire. Whether the timing was decided by the Russians or by Mr. Assange, it proved devastatingly effective.\nDavid Michael Smith, a Houston political scientist and activist, spotted the alarming call on Facebook. A group called Heart of Texas was suddenly urging Texans to come at noon on May 21, 2016, to protest a 14-year-old Islamic center in downtown Houston.\n“Stop Islamization of Texas,” the post declared, with a photo of the Islamic Da’wah Center, which it called a “shrine of hatred.” It invited protesters to prepare for battle: “Feel free to bring along your firearms, concealed or not!”\n“We immediately asked, ‘What the blank is the Heart of Texas’?’” recalled Mr. Smith, who started calling friends to organize a counterprotest.\nMonths later, he would find out.\nHeart of Texas, which garnered a quarter-million followers on Facebook, was one of 470 Facebook pages created 5,000 miles from Houston at the Internet Research Agency, the oddly named St. Petersburg company that would become the world’s most famous manipulator of social media. The two Russian employees who had visited Texas during that 2014 American tour, Ms. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova, evidently had returned home with big ideas about how to exploit the emotional chasms in American politics and culture.\nJust as the Russians’ Guccifer character had reached out to American activists, journalists and WikiLeaks, the Russian online trolls understood that their real political power would come from mobilizing Americans. The Russian company’s formula was simple: tap into a simmering strain of opinion in the United States and pour on the fuel.\nConsider the Texas protest. After the Russians put up the “Stop Islamization” Facebook post, several dozen like-minded Texans added their own incendiary comments. “Allah Sucks,” wrote one, adding a threat to kill any Muslim who tried to visit him. Another wrote of the Islamic center, “Need to Blow this place up.”\nA dozen yelling white supremacists turned out for the protest, at least two of them with assault rifles and a third with a pistol. Others held Confederate flags and a “White Lives Matter” banner.\nHouston police managed to keep them away from a much larger crowd of counterprotesters — some of whom had responded to a second Russian Facebook call. In a blatant attempt to create a confrontation, another Internet Research Agency page, this one called United Muslims of America, had asked people to rally at exactly the same time and place to “Save Islamic Knowledge.”\nThe event had no lasting consequences, though clearly it could have ended in tragedy. Still, it demonstrated that young Russians tapping on keyboards in 12-hour shifts could act as puppet masters for unsuspecting Americans many time zones away.\nWhen Facebook first acknowledged last year the Russian intrusion on its platform, it seemed modest in scale. The $100,000 spent on ads was a trivial sum compared with the tens of millions spent on Facebook by both the Trump and Clinton campaigns.\nBut it quickly became clear that the Russians had used a different model for their influence campaign: posting inflammatory messages and relying on free, viral spread. Even by the vertiginous standards of social media, the reach of their effort was impressive: 2,700 fake Facebook accounts, 80,000 posts, many of them elaborate images with catchy slogans, and an eventual audience of\n on Facebook alone.

The trolls created at least \n, posted Vine videos, blogged on Tumblr, sought donations via PayPal and even exploited the \n.\nWithout American social media companies, the Russian influence campaign could not have operated. The St. Petersburg trolls tapped the power of Silicon Valley for their stealth intervention in American democracy.\nDarren Linvill, a professor at Clemson University who has \n, said he was “impressed with both their level of absurdist creativity and keen understanding of American psychology.” They knew “exactly what buttons to press” and operated with “industrial efficiency,” he said.\nThe Russian troll operation had gotten its start two years before, focusing at first on government targets closer to home.\nIn 2014, Vitaly Bespalov, then 23, finished a journalism degree in the Siberian city of Tyumen and signed on as a “content manager” at the Internet Research Agency, which looked vaguely like a digital marketing firm and offered a relatively generous salary of $1,000 a month.\nMr. Bespalov was surprised to discover that his job was to write or swipe stories to post on counterfeit Ukrainian websites, spinning the conflict there to fit the Russian government’s view. He had to be sure always to use the word “terrorists” for the Ukrainian fighters opposed to the Russian invasion that was tearing the country apart.\n“My first days on the job I was in shock — I had no idea what kind of an operation this was,” Mr. Bespalov said in a recent interview while vacationing in Ukraine: his first visit to the country about which he had written so many bogus stories.\nHe was put off by the company’s work but said he chose to stick around for several months, in part to study its operations. “It was very monotonous and boring,” Mr. Bespalov said. “It seemed that almost no one liked this work. But almost nobody quit, because everyone needed the money.”\nSoon he began hearing about a new, secretive department inside the St. Petersburg company that was recruiting English speakers to focus on the United States.\nLike Peter the Great, the Internet Research Agency borrowed Western technology while shunning Western notions of democracy. As Mr. Bespalov quickly realized, the company was not a normal business but a well-compensated tool of the Russian state. It was owned by \n, who overcame an early prison sentence for robbery to create a thriving catering business. He then built a fortune as a loyal contractor willing to provide internet trolls, mercenary soldiers or anything else required by his patron, Mr. Putin.\nIn the company’s new department, some 80 young English speakers worked in shifts to feed Facebook pages and Twitter accounts imitating the snark and fury of outraged Americans. They stole photos, favoring attractive young women, for their Twitter profiles. They copied or created sharp poster-like commentaries on American life and politics, only occasionally slipping up with grammatical mistakes. They focused their efforts on \n, with names like “Guns4Life,” “Pray for Police,” “Stop All Invaders,” “South United” and — mimicking Mr. Trump — “America First.”\nIf Mr. Trump was borrowing the hacked emails from the Russians for his stump speeches, the online trolls in St. Petersburg returned the favor, picking up the candidate’s populist rhetoric. Even pages that seemed nominally hostile to him often worked in his favor: “Woke Blacks” critiqued Mrs. Clinton for alleged hostility to African-Americans; “United Muslims of America” showed her with a woman in a head scarf and a slogan — “Support Hillary, Save American Muslims” — that seemed aimed at generating a backlash.\nThe Russians managed to call a dozen or more rallies like the one in Houston, sometimes paying unwitting American activists for their help via money transfer. The same method may have been used to get the bridge banners of Mr. Putin and Mr. Obama hung.\nAn Internet Research Agency Twitter account, @cassishere, posted a photo of the Putin banner on the Manhattan Bridge, winning a credit from \n. In Washington, the Russian account @LeroyLovesUSA tweeted about suspending \n, then added more tweets with critiques of Mr. Obama’s foreign policy in stilted English.\nFacebook, reluctant to step into the divisive politics of the Trump presidency, did not acknowledge the Russian intrusion until nearly a year after the election, asserting that Russia had chiefly aimed at sowing division. A closer look suggested a more focused goal: damaging Mrs. Clinton and promoting Mr. Trump.\nMany of the Facebook memes portrayed Mrs. Clinton as angry, corrupt or crazed. Mr. Trump was depicted as his campaign preferred: strong, decisive, courageous, willing to shun political correctness to tell hard truths. The Russian operation also boosted Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate who had dined with Mr. Putin in Moscow, to draw votes from Mrs. Clinton. It encouraged supporters of Mr. Sanders to withhold their votes from Mrs. Clinton even after he endorsed her.\nThe impact is impossible to gauge; the Internet Research Agency was a Kremlin fire hose of influence wielded amid a hurricane of a presidential election. Christopher Painter, who had served under President George W. Bush at the Justice Department and as the State Department’s coordinator for cyberissues from 2011 to 2017, said the propaganda flood and the leaked emails certainly affected the vote. But no one can say whether it made the difference in an election decided by the tiniest of margins, fewer than 100,000 votes in three states.\n“It’s impossible to know how much voter suppression it caused, discouraging people from coming out,” Mr. Painter said. “It’s impossible to know how many votes it changed.”\nHe added that “people don’t like to admit they’ve been fooled” — hence the strenuous efforts from Mr. Trump and his supporters to deny or dismiss the significance of the Russian interference.\nA case in point would be Harry Miller, a devoted Trump supporter in Florida who was paid to organize a rally in which a woman portraying Mrs. Clinton sat behind bars on the back of his pickup truck. It turned out that the people who had ordered up the rally, “Matt Skiber” and “Joshua Milton,” were pseudonyms for Russians at the Internet Research Agency, according to the Mueller indictment.\nBut don’t tell that to Mr. Miller. Contacted via Twitter, he insisted that he had not been manipulated by Russian trolls.\n“They were not Russians, and you know it,” Mr. Miller wrote, adding, “If you don’t then you are the one snookered.”\nThe White House statement released at 7:21 p.m. on May 17, 2017, was measured, even anodyne. Reacting to the news that Mr. Mueller had been appointed special counsel for the Russia investigation, the statement quoted Mr. Trump saying that he was “looking forward to this matter concluding quickly,” and that in the meantime he would be fighting “for the people and issues that matter most to the future of our country.”\nExactly 12 hours and 31 minutes later, early in the morning without his staff around him, he told the world what he really thought.\n“This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!” he wrote in \n.\nIt had been little more than a week since the president had fired his F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, but the “Russia thing” wasn’t going away. Now the president was up against someone who could become even more formidable — a careful, tenacious former Marine whose stewardship of the F.B.I. during the Bush and Obama years had been praised by Washington’s establishment.\nMr. Trump’s instinct was to fire Mr. Mueller, but he settled for a different strategy. He has used all his power to try to discredit the special counsel’s investigation.\nRevelation upon revelation about Russian encounters with Trump associates has followed in the months since Mr. Mueller was appointed, intensifying the fear in the White House. Mr. Trump has used his Twitter pulpit to repeatedly assault the Mueller inquiry, and has made scathing remarks at rallies about claims of Russian interference. “It’s a hoax, O.K.?” he told a Pennsylvania crowd last month. The attacks have had an impact on how Americans view the country’s national security apparatus, how they view the Russia story, even how they view Russia itself.\nThe strategy has helped sow doubts about the special counsel’s work in part because Mr. Mueller and his prosecutors only rarely go public with the evidence they have been steadily gathering in secret interviews and closed-door sessions of a grand jury.\nDuring a period of 146 days over this year — between the Feb. 16 indictment of the Internet Research Agency operatives and the July 13 indictment of Russian intelligence officers — Mr. Mueller’s office was effectively silent. The president was not, sending at least 94 tweets that denied he had been involved in “collusion,” called the Russian interference a “hoax” or labeled the Mueller investigation a “witch hunt.”\nIndictment of Internet \nResearch Agency operatives\nIndictment of Russian\nintelligence officers\nEach box represents one Trump tweet calling the Russia investigation a “\n,” or a “\n,” or disputes any notion of “\n.”\nApril\nJuly\nOct.\nApril\nJuly\nJan. 2017\nJan. 2018\nEach box represents one Trump tweet calling the investigation a “\n,” or a “\n,” or disputes any notion of “\n.”\nJan. 2017\nApril\nJuly\nOct.\nJan. 2018\nIndictment of Internet\nResearch Agency operatives\nApril\nIndictment of Russian\nintelligence officers\nJuly\nEach box represents one Trump tweet calling the investigation a “\n,” or a “\n,” or disputes any notion of “\n.”\nIndictment of Internet\nResearch Agency operatives\nIndictment of Russian\nintelligence officers\nJan. \n2017\nApril\nJuly\nOct.\nJan. \n2018\nApril\nJuly\nEach box represents one Trump tweet calling the Russia investigation a “\n,” or a “\n,” or disputes any notion of “\n.”\nJan. 2017\nApril\nJuly\nOct.\nJan. 2018\nIndictment of Internet\nResearch Agency operatives\nApril\nIndictment of Russian\nintelligence officers\nJuly\nBy July, one poll showed that 45 percent of Americans disapproved of how Mr. Mueller was handling the investigation, a 14-point increase from January. The shift was even more dramatic among Republican voters: from 49 percent to 78 percent. More recent polls, conducted since the indictment of the G.R.U. officers and Mr. Manafort’s conviction, have shown a reversal of the trend.\nThe president’s aides hardly make a secret of their goal to discredit the investigation before a jury of the public. There is little expectation that Mr. Mueller would ignore Justice Department guidelines and try to indict a sitting president, so Mr. Trump’s lawyers see Congress and impeachment as the only threat. Turn the public against impeachment, the thinking goes, and Congress is less likely to act.\n“Mueller is now slightly more distrusted than trusted, and Trump is a little ahead of the game,” Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s omnipresent lawyer, told The New York Times last month, without citing any data to buttress his assertion.\n“So I think we’ve done really well,” he said. “And my client’s happy.”\nMr. Trump’s frustration with the Russian investigation is not surprising. He is right that no public evidence has emerged showing that his campaign conspired with Russia in the election interference or accepted Russian money. But the inquiry has buffeted his presidency, provoked concern that his attempts to thwart the investigation amount to obstruction of justice and fed his suspicion that the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies — what he calls “the deep state” — are conspiring against him.\nThe desire of the president to make deals with Mr. Putin, and the longstanding skepticism of the intelligence community about Russian intentions and actions, might have made a clash inevitable. But Mr. Trump appears to have had success in persuading some Americans that the spy and law enforcement agencies are corrupt and hyperpartisan. He has scrambled alliances that solidified over decades, including the Republican Party’s reflexive support of the national security agencies. A president in open war with the F.B.I., once inconceivable, is now part of the daily news cycle.\nMr. Trump began laying the foundation immediately after he won the presidency, when he questioned the intelligence agencies’ findings that Russia had disrupted the election, and likened America’s spies to Nazis. Since taking office, he has worked with partners in Congress to cast the agencies as part of an insurgency against the White House.\nIt continued in July, when he stood next to Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, and declared that he trusted the Russian president’s assurances that Moscow was innocent of interfering in the 2016 election.\nAnd it continues today. Early one morning last week, hours before flying to Pennsylvania to honor the victims of the flight that crashed on Sept. 11, 2001, the president fired off \n that appeared to quote something he had seen on Fox News.\n“‘We have found nothing to show collusion between President Trump & Russia, absolutely zero, but every day we get more documentation showing collusion between the FBI & DOJ, the Hillary campaign, foreign spies & Russians, incredible.’”\nThe reshuffling of alliances has seeped into the media, where the president’s reliable allies have been joined by voices on the left to dismiss the Russia story as overblown. They warn of a new Red Scare.\nOn Fox News, the network where Sean Hannity fulminates nightly about Mr. Mueller and his team, the journalist Glenn Greenwald, a founder of the left-leaning news site The Intercept and a champion of government whistle-blowers, has appeared regularly to dismiss revelations about the investigation and decry officials “willing to leak, even at the expense of committing crimes,” in order to damage Mr. Trump.\nMultiple frenzied television segments and hyped news stories have given credence to the concerns of Mr. Greenwald and others about a 21st-century McCarthyism. And critics of the “deep state” were given powerful ammunition after the release of text messages between two F.B.I. officials involved in the Russia investigation, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, that revealed their animosity toward Mr. Trump. The pair, who were involved in a romantic relationship at the time, have been skewered regularly on Mr. Hannity’s show as the “Trump-hating F.B.I. lovebirds.”\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump’s glowing words about Mr. Putin and Russia have created a new affinity for Russia — in particular its social conservatism and toughness on terrorism — among Mr. Trump’s most devoted supporters.\nDuring a period of myriad accounts about Russia’s attempts to disrupt the last election, the percentage of Republicans who view Mr. Putin favorably has more than doubled (from 11 percent to 25 percent), according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. Democrats are now far more likely than Republicans to see Russia as a threat. An October 2017 poll showed that 63 percent of Democrats and just 38 percent of Republicans said they saw “Russia’s power and influence” as a significant threat to the United States.\nOnce again, Mr. Trump has flipped the script in the party of Reagan: A country that was once seen as a geopolitical foe is now embraced by many Republicans as a bastion of Christianity and traditional values.\nMichael McFaul, ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, said that despite the country’s relative economic and military weakness, Mr. Putin had often played a poor hand deftly. “Across many dimensions, Putin is using all kinds of instruments of power,” he said.\n“It feels to me,” the former ambassador said, “like he’s winning and we’re losing.”\nOn July 16, the president woke early in Helsinki, hours before he was to sit face to face with Mr. Putin. The meeting came three days after Mr. Mueller indicted the 12 Russian intelligence officers. Once again, Mr. Trump dashed off a tweet.\n“Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” he \n.\nRussia’s foreign ministry responded with a \n tweet hours later.\n“We agree.”\nKitty Bennett contributed research.

Dowd\nAttorney at Law\nWashington, D.C. 20015\nRobert S. Mueller\nSpecial Counsel\nUnited States Department of Justice\nWashington, D.C. 20024\nRe: Request for Testimony on Alleged Obstruction of Justice\nGentlemen:\nThis letter will address the recent request by your office for an interview with the President and our discussions with you concerning the same on November 21, 2017, and January 8, 2018.\nIn our conversation of January 8, your office identified the following topics as areas you desired to address with the President in order to complete your investigation on the subjects of alleged collusion and obstruction of justice:\nMaggie Haberman\nIt is our understanding that the reason behind the request for the interview is to allow the Special Counsel’s office to complete its report. After reviewing the list of topics you presented, it is abundantly clear to the undersigned that all of the answers to your inquiries are contained in the exhibits and testimony that have already been voluntarily provided to you by the White House and witnesses, all of which clearly show that there was no collusion with Russia, and that no FBI investigation was or even could have been obstructed.\nIt remains our position that the President’s actions here, by virtue of his position as the chief law enforcement officer, could neither constitutionally nor legally constitute obstruction because that would amount to him obstructing himself, and that\n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n.\nNevertheless, the President’s strong desire for transparency indicated the need to obtain an honest and complete factual report from the Special Counsel, which would sustain and even benefit the Office of the President and the national interest throughout his time in office. Thus, full cooperation was in order, and was in fact provided by all relevant parties.\n                  \n                \n                \nCharlie Savage\nWe express again, as we have expressed before, that the Special Counsel’s inquiry has been and remains a considerable burden for the President and his Office, has endangered the safety and security of our country, and has interfered with the President’s ability to both govern domestically and conduct foreign affairs. This encumbrance has been only compounded by the \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n and the establishment of the Office of Special Counsel in the first place.\nThe Special Counsel acknowledged that he was aware of and understands this burden and, accordingly, has committed to expedite his effort.\n                  \n                \n                \nCharlie Savage\nCounsel for both sides developed an informal, confidential, and cooperative relationship to expedite the conclusion of the inquiry. It was agreed that all conversations were confidential and “off the record” so as to encourage candor and engagement as opposed to adversarial hostility. It was agreed that each side could call or meet at any time to facilitate the exchange of information. \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n\n                  \n                \n                \nMichael S. Schmidt\nWe all remain in agreement that your office has received unprecedented access and voluntary cooperation in the collection of all documents requested from the White House\n, the Donald J. Trump For President, Inc. (the “Campaign”)\n, and individual witnesses\n, and that our offices have developed a collegial and professional working relationship which encourages honesty and candor. Further, we all agree that your office and the Congressional Committees have received the full cooperation and testimony of both present and former White House staff members, including White House Counsel, as well as the President’s most senior advisers and his most senior Campaign employees. The majority of that information could have been rightfully withheld on multiple privilege grounds, including but not limited to the presidential communications privilege\n.\nWe cannot emphasize enough that \n, in the interest of complete transparency, the President has allowed — in fact, has directed — the voluntary production of clearly protected documents. This is because the President’s desire for transparency exceeded the policy purposes for the privilege under the circumstances. Without question, the privilege “attaches not only to direct communications with the President, but also to discussions between his senior advisors, who must be able to hold confidential meetings to discuss advice they secretly will render to the President.”\n The privilege applies and is available for the President to claim here because “restricting the presidential communications privilege to communications that directly involve the President will impede the President’s ability to perform his constitutional duty.”\n[C]ommunications made by presidential advisers in the course of preparing advice for the President come under the presidential communications privilege, even when these communications are not made directly to the President. Given the need to provide sufficient elbow room for advisers to obtain information from all knowledgeable sources, the privilege must apply both to communications which these advisers solicited and received from others as well as those they authored themselves. The privilege must also extend to communications authored or received in response to a solicitation by members of a presidential adviser’s staff, since in many instances advisers must rely on their staff to investigate an issue and formulate the advice to be given to the President.\nThe privilege applies to communications authored or solicited and received by members of an immediate White House adviser’s staff who are responsible for advising the President.\nAs you know,\n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \nAmple academic and jurisprudential material supports this important principle. Moreover, as we have indicated in our meetings, we are reminded of our duty to protect the President and his Office. \n                  \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n121 F.3d 729 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (the “\n case), that those seeking information from the President must “demonstrate with specificity why it is likely that the subpoenaed materials [here, his testimony] contain important evidence and why this evidence, or equivalent evidence, is not practically available from another source.”\n\n                  \n                \n                \nCharlie Savage\nCharlie Savage\nAlthough there is not a lot of case law directly on point concerning the issue at hand, scholars have noted that the law here is clear, being that the “[\n] two prong analysis developed·as the D.C. Circuit construed the meaning of a ‘demonstrated, specific need’ over the course of two decades,” and that while “the first requirement is essentially the equivalent of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17(c) .... [t]he second requirement entails detailed documentation of efforts to obtain the needed information from other sources:”\nIn an effort to provide complete transparency, the President waived the obviously applicable privileges where appropriate in order to allow both the Congress and the Special Counsel to see all relevant documents.\n The documents provided include notes from and concerning advisors at the highest level. They reflect contemporaneous corroboration, which is an inherently and fundamentally weightier type of evidence — unlike former FBI Director James Comey’s (Mr. Comey’s) testimony. Perhaps most notably, your office has already been given access to conversations with the President himself. Case law in this district teaches that for the presumptive privilege to possibly be overcome and the requisite need and specificity sufficiently demonstrated, the need for the exact “content of a conversation” involving high-level White House advisers must be “undeniable” and “the only sources of that testimony are those persons participating in the conversations.”\n \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n The information you seek is “practically available from another source,”\n and your office, in fact, has already been given that other source.\n                  \n                \n                \nCharlie Savage\nWe have, pursuant to the standard set forth in the \ncase, carefully reviewed your list of questions and the topics you have identified, and we have concluded that your office \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \nprovided by the President, the White House, his staff, the Trump campaign and the Trump organization. This letter will respond to your inquiries, and direct your attention to the evidence and testimony that is already in your possession.\n                  \n                \n                \nMatt Apuzzo\nIn our most recent meeting, you mentioned the possibility of obstruction in connection with the case of former National Security Advisor and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (Ret.)  “Lt. Gen. Flynn”), and that you desired to speak with the President specifically regarding his conversation with then-Director Comey one day after the President fired Lt. Gen. Flynn for lying to the Vice President. You have already been provided the testimony of White House Counsel and his extensive internal file memo as well as the testimony and notes of the President’s Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus  “Mr. Priebus”), and other members of the White House Counsel’s office. According to former Mr. Comey, the following occurred at a February 14, 2017, meeting between him and the President:\nThe President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, “He is a good guy and has been through a lot.” He repeated that Flynn hadn’t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” I replied only that “he is a good guy.” ... I did not say I would “let this go.”\nThe White House denied and refuted that the President said these words to Mr. Comey.\n We decline to recommend to the President that he be interviewed on this subject for many reasons.\nWhat follows is a non-exhaustive list:\n\n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \nUnder § 1505, a “pending proceeding” is limited only to agencies with rule-making or adjudicative authority. The investigation of Lt. Gen. Flynn was being conducted by the FBI, which possesses only investigative authority, not adjudicative; it cannot conduct “proceedings” within the cognizance of§ 1505.\nNo court has ever held than an FBI investigation constitutes a § 1505 proceeding, and the U.S. Attorney’s Manual makes clear that “investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are not §1505 proceedings.”\nThe DOJ has even expressly acknowledged as much to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\nAs a matter of law, then, the FBI’s investigation of Lt. Gen. Flynn was not, at the time of the President’s comments as recalled by Mr. Comey, within the scope of § 1505.\n                  \n                \n                \nCharlie Savage\nThe following facts are taken from information voluntarily provided to your office or from information that is publicly available. These facts further demonstrate that the President did not obstruct justice in any manner concerning Lt. Gen. Flynn.\nAccording to Acting Attorney General Sally Yates  (“Ms. Yates”), on January 24, 2017, Lt. Gen. Flynn was interviewed by the FBI. According to reports, “The FBI interviewers believed Flynn was cooperative and provided truthful answers. Although Flynn didn’t remember all of what he talked about, they don’t believe he was intentionally misleading them, the officials say.”\nThis account of the FBl’s interview and subsequent conclusions was later confirmed by the closed-door congressional testimony of Mr. Comey.\n Mr. Comey also confirmed in his May 3, 2017, Senate Intelligence Committee testimony that he “did participate in conversations about that matter” with Ms. Yates, referring to the FBl’s interview of Lt. Gen. Flynn. before she conveyed the information to the White House in the days that followed.\nOn January 26, 2017, Ms. Yates met with White House Counsel Don McGahn (“Mr. McGahn”). As outlined by Mr. McGahn in his White House Counsel’s Office memo dated February 15, 2017,\n  “Yates expressed two principal concerns during the meeting: (1) that Flynn may have made false representations to others in the Administration regarding the content of the calls; and (2) that Flynn’s potentially false statements could make him susceptible to foreign influence or blackmail because the Russians would know he had lied.” “Yates further indicated that on January 24, 2017, FBI agents had questioned Flynn about his contacts with Kislyak. Yates claimed that Flynn’s statements to the FBI were similar to those she understood he had made to Spicer and the Vice President.”\nOn January 26, 2017, Mr. McGahn briefed the President concerning the information conveyed by Ms. Yates. Additional advisors were brought in, including White House Chief of Staff Mr. Priebus. It was agreed that additional information would be needed before any action was taken. As recorded by Mr. McGahn, “Part of this concern was a recognition by McGahn that it was unclear from the meeting with Yates whether an action could be taken \n” At that time “President Trump asked McGahn to further look into the issue as well as finding out more about the calls.”\nOn January 27, 2017, at Mr. McGahn’s request, Ms. Yates and Mr. McGahn had another meeting. \nDuring the meeting, McGahn sought clarification regarding Yates’s prior statements regarding Flynn’s contact with Ambassador Kislyak. Among the issues discussed was whether dismissal of Flynn by the President would compromise any ongoing investigations. Yates was unwilling to confirm or deny that there was an ongoing investigation but did indicate that the DOJ would not object to the White House taking action against Flynn. (Emphasis added.)\nFurther supporting the White House’s understanding that there was no FBI investigation that could conceivably have been impeded, \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n In other words, the DOJ expressed that the White House could make public that Lt. Gen. Flynn’s calls with Ambassador Kislyak had been surveilled. It seems quite unlikely that if an ongoing DOJ investigation of Lt. Gen. Flynn was underway, the DOJ would approve its key investigation methods and sources being publicized.\n                  \n                \n                \nCharlie Savage\nYour office is also aware that, in the week leading up to Lt. Gen. Flynn’s termination and the President’s alleged comments to Mr. Comey, Lt. Gen. Flynn had told both White House Counsel and the Chief of Staff at least twice that the FBI agents had told him he would \n be charged. The first instance occurred during a discussion at the White House on February 8, 2017, between Mr. McGahn, Mr. Priebus, Mr. John Eisenberg and Lt. Gen. Flynn. “Priebus led the questioning” and “asked Flynn whether Flynn spoke about sanctions on his call with Ambassador Kislyak.” Lt. Gen. Flynn’s “recollection was inconclusive” and he responded that “he either was not sure whether he discussed sanctions, or did not remember doing so.” “Priebus specifically asked Flynn whether he was interviewed by the FBI. Flynn stated that FBI agents met with him to inform him that their investigation was over.” The second occurred on a telephone call on February 10, 2017, wherein Mr. McGahn, Mr. Priebus, and the Vice President confronted Lt. Gen. Flynn concerning his discussions with Ambassador Kislyak. As recorded in Mr. McGahn’s memo, \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n\n                  \n                \n                \nMichael S. Schmidt\nOn February 10, 2017, upon confirming the true content and nature of Lt. Gen. Flynn’s three telephone calls with Ambassador Kislyak, and in light of his statements to them and the Vice President, White House Counsel Don McGahn and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus advised the President that Lt. Gen. Flynn “had to be let go.” As a result, on February 13, 2017, the President accepted Lt. Gen. Flynn’s resignation.\nAccording to Mr. Comey’s testimony, the next day, on February 14, 2017, the President made comments expressing his “hope” that Mr. Comey “could see [his] way to letting this go” in reference to the situation with Lt. Gen. Flynn. The White House disputed Mr. Comey’s recollection of that conversation. Regardless, the White House Counsel and Chief of Staff, as well as others surrounding the President, had every reason to believe at that time that the FBI was not investigating Lt. Gen. Flynn, especially in light of the fact that Lt. Gen. Flynn was allowed to keep his active security clearance.\nFor all intents, purposes, and appearances, the FBI had accepted Flynn’s account; concluded that he was confused but truthful; decided not to investigate him further; and let him retain his clearance. As far as he could tell, the President was the \n who decided to continue gathering and reviewing the facts in order to ascertain whether Lt. Gen. Flynn’s actions necessitated severe and consequential action — removal from office. The President ordered his White House Counsel to continue its review of the situation, which ultimately concluded that Lt. Gen. Flynn had misled the Vice President. The President did not obstruct justice. To the contrary, he facilitated it.\nWe emphasize these points because even if an FBI investigation constituted a ‘’proceeding” under the statute, which it does not, the statute also requires \n to obstruct. There could not possibly have been intent to obstruct an “investigation” that had been neither confirmed nor denied to White House Counsel, and that they had every reason (based on Lt. Gen. Flynn’s statements and his continued security clearance) to assume was not ongoing. Further, by insisting on and accepting Lt. Gen. Flynn’s public resignation as national security adviser, the President expedited the pursuit of justice while the DOJ and the FBI were apparently taking no action.\nSo, to reiterate, within seventeen days of first being advised by DOJ leadership concerning Lt. Gen. Flynn, and within just three days of the President’s senior team confirming the requisite facts, the President took decisive action and directed Lt. Gen. Flynn, his highest ranking national security advisor, to resign. The President did so in spite of the fact that the FBI had, apparently, decided not to pursue the case further. The President did so in spite of the great political cost to himself. \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n. His actions speak louder than any words.\n                  \n                \n                \nMichael S. Schmidt\n\n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n, the “hard” evidence already voluntarily provided to your office shows not only that the President most certainly did not obstruct justice, \n. If Mr. Comey had believed otherwise, he would have opened an obstruction investigation and directed his investigators accordingly. He did not do so.\n                  \n                \n                \nMatt Apuzzo\nWhat the entire allegation of obstruction amounts to, then, is a critical examination of the conversation that occurred between the President and then-Director Comey on the night of February 14, 2017, in light of Mr. Comey’s self-serving testimony and leaked memos. Again, according to Mr. Comey’s prepared testimony, the following occurred during that February 14 meeting:\nThe President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, “He is a good guy and has been through a lot.” He repeated that Flynn hadn’t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” I replied only that “he is a good guy.” (In fact, I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he was a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI.) I did not say I would “let this go.”\nOn June 8, 2017, Mr. Comey was asked about that conversation in great detail. While acknowledging that the President only said “hope,” Mr. Comey said he took it as a direction. However in his Senate Judiciary Committee testimony he responded as follows:\n He did not direct you to let it go. \n Not in his words. no. \n He did not order you to let it go. \n Again, those words are not an order. \n He said “I hope.” Now, like me you probably did hundreds of cases, maybe thousands of cases charging people with criminal offenses, and, of course, you have knowledge of the thousands of cases out there that where people have been charged. Do you know of any case where a person has been charged for obstruction of justice, or for that matter, any other criminal offense, where . . . they said or thought they “hoped” for an outcome? \n I don’t know well enough to answer. And the reason I keep saying his words is I took it as a direction. It is the president of the United States with me, alone, saying ”I hope” this. I took it as this is what he wants me to do. I didn’t obey that, but that’s the way I took it.\n You may have taken it as a direction, but that’s not what he said. He said — he said ”I hope.” \n Those are the exact words, correct. \n You don’t know of anyone that has ever been charged for hoping something, is that a fair statement?  \n I don’t, as l sit here.\nThe White House refuted Mr. Comey’s account in a statement:\n“While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation. including any investigation involving General Flynn. The president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies. and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.”\nEven if we were to ignore the White House’s version of events and take Comey’s “understanding” at face value, Mr. Comey did not confront the President, nor did he report the “attempted obstruction.” He also did not “let this go,” and he received no further communication from the President or any other person from the White House on the matter.\nMr. Comey himself, very significantly, admitted that he did nothing in response to the so-called “direction” except make self-serving notes. He admitted he did not raise an objection with the President to what he “understood.” He did not open an obstruction investigation of the President. \n Had he really understood the President to be attempting to obstruct justice, undoubtedly he would not have made that would-be false statement.\nIn his testimony Mr. Comey admitted that not only did he fail to confront the President, at the time \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n then conducting the counterintelligence investigation on collusion that he believed he had received any such direction from the President. Instead, he claimed he only told his senior FBI leadership, but did nothing to act on it. Interestingly, Mr. Comey claimed he did not tell the Attorney General because he thought that the Attorney General was going to recuse himself. While this is certainly a significant assumption by Mr. Comey and raises significant questions, it still does not justify failing to tell the DOJ about the alleged conversation — if Mr. Comey truly perceived it the way he now claims he did. And, two days after Mr. Comey was removed, the most senior member of his FBI leadership, Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, \n by testifying that, “\n                  \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n Again, the contemporaneous testimony of his senior colleague, and the inaction of Mr. Comey himself, all make clear that at the time of the conversation in question Mr. Comey did not really understand the President to be attempting an obstruction of justice. Recall that Mr. Comey’s June 8, 2017 testimony (after his termination) about the conversation followed both Mr. McCabe’s testimony and \n on May 3, 2017, just six days before his termination, that “it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something ... for a political reason. That would be a very big deal. It’s not happened in my experience.”\n\n                  \n                \n                \nMatt Apuzzo\nMatt Apuzzo\nIn addition, the New York Times reported that following a March 30, 2017, telephone call with the President, Mr. Comey said “that his relationship with the president and the White House staff was now in the right place. ‘I think we’ve kind of got them trained,’ Mr. Wittes said, paraphrasing what Mr. Comey told him.”\n On March 8, 2017, Mr. Comey told an audience at a cybersecurity conference,  ‘You’re stuck with me for another 6-1/2 years,’ indicating he expects to serve the remainder of his 10-year term” — and also belying any sentiment that he was suffering under the pressure of a Presidential directive he was refusing to execute.\nAll of these facts refute the novel account Mr. Comey articulated only \n he was fired and after he had, by his own admission, leaked information \n to “prompt the appointment of a special counsel”\n — despite never suggesting, while in his position as FBI Director, that a special counsel was necessary or that obstruction had occurred.\nYou have asked for evidence related to the firing of Mr. Comey, including information on with whom the President consulted in advance of the decision to let Mr. Comey go, in an attempt to see if this firing, in and of itself, might constitute obstruction of justice. Again, we note that you have been voluntarily provided with abundant materials and possess all of the answers to your questions, including how the President evaluated Mr. Comey’s performance. As such, and pursuant to \n, we respectfully decline to allow our client to testify. As is now apparent with the benefit of subsequent developments, the firing of Mr. Comey has led to the discovery of corruption within the FBI at the highest levels.\n\n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \nTo the extent that such an action has an impact on any investigation pending before the FBI, that impact is simply an effect of the President’s lawful exercise of his constitutional power and cannot constitute obstruction of justice here. \n                  \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n\n                  \n                \n                \nCharlie Savage\nCharlie Savage\n\n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n Such an action obviously has an impact on the investigation, but that is simply an effect of the President’s lawful exercise of his constitutional power and cannot constitute obstruction of justice. \n                  \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n\n                  \n                \n                \nCharlie Savage\nCharlie Savage\nThe following facts are based on Mr. Comey’s June 8, 2017, testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ June 13, 2017, testimony.\nBased on this testimony, the President did not commit obstruction of justice.\n The only possible evidence, taken in the light most favorable to your office, is the single memo from Mr. Comey.\n \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n In addition, Mr. Comey could possibly face legal action for the unauthorized leaking of conversations with the President to the media,\n an admission especially noteworthy given his refusal to comment on conversations with the President in, for example, his March 20, 2017, congressional testimony, during which he refused to answer questions about conversations with the President, indicating that such information should not be shared publicly.\n\n                  \n                \n                \nCharlie Savage\nThere is no other evidence to validate Mr. Comey’s claims since Attorney General Sessions never substantiated any of the allegations that the President fired Mr. Comey because of the Russian investigation.\n To the contrary, Attorney General Sessions stated that his recommendation to the President was that Mr. Comey be fired because of the way he handled the Clinton email investigation and refusal to admit his mistakes.\nIt is also worth responding to the popular suggestion that the President’s public criticism of the FBI either constitutes obstruction or serves as evidence of obstruction. Such criticism ignores the sacred responsibility of the President to hold his subordinates accountable — a function not unlike public Congressional oversight hearings. After all, the FBI is not above the law and we are now learning of the disappointing results of a lack of accountability in both the DOJ and FBI.\nThe fact is that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  “Mr. Rosenstein”) expressed precisely the same concerns as the President regarding Mr. Comey in his May 9, 2017, Memorandum to Attorney General Jeff Sessions:\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has long been regarded as our nation’s premier federal investigative agency. Over the past year, however, the FBI ‘s reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice. That is deeply troubling to many Department employees and veterans, legislators and citizens.\nTo summarize, the Deputy Attorney General and the Attorney General both agreed, in writing, that Mr. Comey should be fired, for reasons unrelated to any investigation about Russian interference. To quote again from Mr. Rosenstein’s May 9, 2017, memo:\nAlthough the president has the power to remove an FBI director, the decision should not be taken lightly. I agree with the nearly unanimous opinions of former department officials. The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a Director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them. Having refused to admit his errors, the Director cannot be expected to implement the necessary corrective actions.\nAs you also know, far from merely signing off on a Presidential decision or taking a weak or indirect action indicating a tacit or pressured approval, \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n It is unthinkable that a President acting (l) under his Constitutional authority; (2) on the written recommendation and with the overt participation of his Deputy Attorney General; and (3) consistent with the advice of his Attorney General, to fire a subordinate who has been universally condemned by bipartisan leadership\n could then be accused of obstruction for doing so.\n                  \n                \n                \nMatt Apuzzo\nMany in the media have relied on mischaracterizations of the President’s remarks in a May 11, 2017, interview with Mr. Lester Holt of NBC News, to claim or suggest that in that interview, the President stated that the real reason he fired Comey is the Russia investigation.\n Unfortunately, so has Mr. Comey. He testified that: “I [take] the president, at his word, that I was fired because of the Russia investigation.”\n Regrettably, no one asked Mr. Comey when he thought the President had actually said any such thing because, in fact, \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n.\n                  \n                \n                \nCharlie Savage\nBecause it has been so widely misreported and mischaracterized, we believe it is important to present the exchange in its entirety. What the President actually said was this: “I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it. And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.”\n The President and Mr. Holt then talk over each other for approximately a minute, before the President completed his original thought by saying,\nAs far as I’m concerned, I want that thing [the Russia investigation] to be absolutely done properly. When I did this now, I said I probably maybe will confuse people. Maybe I’ll expand that- you know, I’ll lengthen the time because it should be over with. It should — in my opinion, should’ve been over with a long time ago because it — all it is an excuse. But I said to myself I might even lengthen out the investigation. But I have to do the right thing for the American people. He’s the wrong man for that position.\nLater in the interview, the following exchange took place:\n I want very simply a great FBI director. \n And will you expect if they would — they would continue on with this investigation .... \n \n \n.”\nReading the entire interview, the fair reading of the President’s remarks demonstrates that the President:\nThere have also been press reports — \n — about comments the President allegedly made during a May 9, 2017, meeting with Russian government officials that Comey was a “real nut job’’ and that “great pressure because of Russia” has been “taken off” him.\n \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n (regardless of the validity of such an opinion, presumably any President would not want someone he considered a “nut job” running the FBI); and (ii) in any event would be irrelevant to the constitutional analysis. A short, separate, classified response addressing this subject will be submitted to the Office of Special Counsel.\n                  \n                \n                \nMatt Apuzzo and Maggie Haberman\nOn a related note, you had expressed a desire for information related to conversations with intelligence officials generally regarding ongoing investigations. The intelligence chiefs themselves have already very clearly testified on the subject before Congress. In the words of Director Rogers,  “In the three-plus years that I have been the director of the National Security Agency, to the best of my recollection, I have never been directed to do anything I believe to be illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate, and to the best of my recollection during that same period of service I do not recall ever feeling pressured to do so.” Director Coats testified in a very similar vein: “In my time of service, which is interacting with the President of the United States or anybody in his administration, I have never been pressured — I have never felt pressured — to intervene or interfere in any way with shaping intelligence in a political way or in relation to an ongoing investigation.”\nYou have received all of the notes, communications and testimony indicating that \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n to the \n article on behalf of his son, Donald Trump, Jr. His son then followed up by making a full public disclosure regarding the meeting, including his public testimony that there was nothing to the meeting and certainly no evidence of collusion.\n\n                  \n                \n                \nMaggie Haberman\n\n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n The President is not required to answer to the Office of the Special Counsel, or anyone else, for his private affairs with his children. In any event, the President’s son, son-in-law, and White House advisors and staff have made a full disclosure on these events to both your office and the congressional committees.\n\n                  \n                \n                \nCharlie Savage\nAccordingly, based upon the foregoing, we have advised the President that, pursuant to the standard clearly set forth in \n and its progeny, your inquiry thus far demonstrates that no obstruction of the Flynn investigation or Russian collusion investigation appears to have occurred, and that your office has already been provided the voluminous testimony and documentation from which this conclusion is clearly drawn. Therefore, your office lacks “a focused demonstration of need” for the President’s responses, which is required by law “even when there are allegations of misconduct by high-level officials.”\nAgain, the only statute implicated here is 18 U.S.C. § 1505, but its application to the President is a constitutional and legal impossibility, and even if it were applicable the elements for obstruction simply cannot be satisfied. For further detail and analysis on this point, we respectfully refer you to our letter to your office of June 23, 2017.\nWhat all of the foregoing demonstrates is that, as to the questions that you desire to ask the President, absent any cognizable obstruction offense, and in light of the extraordinary cooperation by the President and all relevant parties, you have been provided with full responses to each of the topics you presented, obviating any need for an interview with the President. As all of the evidence demonstrates, every action that the President took was taken with full constitutional authority pursuant to Article II of the United States Constitution. As such, these actions cannot constitute obstruction, whether viewed separately or even as a totality. As recognized by the Framers in Article II and as articulated in jurisprudence, \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n Having him testify demeans the Office of the President before the world. The imposition on the time and attention of the President caused by this inquiry has already inflicted unwarranted damage on the President and his Office. This imposition is one reason why the President directed the most extensive and transparent cooperation with the numerous requests of the Special Counsel. The time and attention that would be required to prepare for an interview is significant and would represent a continued imposition that would directly impact the nation.\n                  \n                \n                \nCharlie Savage\nMore is at stake here than just this inquiry, more even than just the Presidency of Donald J. Trump. This inquiry, and the precedents set herein, will also impact the Office of the President of the United States of America in perpetuity. Ensuring that the Office remains sacred and above the fray of shifting political winds and gamesmanship is of critical importance. Of course, the President of the United States is not above the law, but just as obvious and equally as true is the fact that the President should not be subjected to strained readings and forced applications of clearly irrelevant statutes.\nIn order to facilitate a fair process, as a practical solution, without waiver of the President’s constitutional and statutory privileges or objections, and in exchange for a rapid conclusion, we are willing to receive any further questions and \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                    \n to help you complete your report and resolve any other remaining questions you might have. We are prepared to meet to discuss a final list of questions that you need to be answered so that the Nation may move forward, and so that we may preserve the dignity of the Office of the President of the United States.\n                  \n                \n                \nMatt Apuzzo\nThank you for your courtesy and cooperation,\nVery Respectfully,\nJohn M.

The fact that President understood that terminating Mr. Comey would not halt the Russia investigation contradicts a finding of corrupt intent and precludes an obstruction of justice violation. Under multiple Supreme Court rulings, conviction for obstruction under the “omnibus clauses” requires a showing that the defendant believed the act in question would have the “natural and probable effect of interfering with” a pending judicial proceeding (18 U.S.C. § l503) or a proceeding before an adjudicative government agency or Congressional inquiry (18 U.S.C. § 1505).

The President’s firing of Mr. Comey would not — and could not have been intended to — have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the FBl’s investigation (assuming for the moment that an FBI investigation is a “proceeding” under§ 1505, which it is not) or the Congressional inquiries. Acting Director McCabe’s testimony makes clear — as the President understood and as would be obvious to anyone — that Mr. Comey’s termination had no impact on the investigation.

Mueller\nSpecial Counsel\nUnited States Department of Justice\nWashington, D.C. 20004\nRe: Governing Constitutional Principles\nDear Mr. Mueller:\nThis firm is personal counsel to President Donald J. Trump. We write to address news reports, purportedly based on leaks, indicating that you may have begun a preliminary inquiry into whether the President’s termination of former FBI Director James Comey constituted obstruction of justice. According to these recent stories, Mr. Comey’s testimony, and his prior assurances to the President, there was no investigation into the President prior to the termination of Mr. Comey. Nevertheless, in the interest of completeness, we will address certain events and issues related to the period before Mr. Comey was terminated as well.\nIt is clear that there is no statutory or Constitutional basis for any obstruction charge based on Mr. Comey’s termination. As Mr. Comey himself stated in the first sentence of his farewell letter to the FBI, “the President can fire the FBI Director for any reason, or no reason at all.” Indeed, the President not only has unfettered statutory and Constitutional authority to terminate the FBI Director, he also has Constitutional authority to direct the Justice Department to open or close an investigation, and, of course, the power to pardon any person before, during, or after an investigation and/or conviction. Put simply, the Constitution leaves no question that the President has exclusive authority over the ultimate conduct and disposition of all criminal investigations and over those executive branch officials responsible for conducting those investigations . Thus, as set forth more fully below, as a matter of law and common sense, the President cannot obstruct himself or subordinates acting on his behalf by simply exercising these inherent Constitutional powers.\nThis is particularly the case where, as here, the Department of Justice, through the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, unequivocally advised the President that the “FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust” unless Director Comey was replaced. That recommendation was supported by, among other things, the almost universal rebukes Mr. Comey’s unprecedented conduct as director had generated from, among many others, President Obama, dozens of Democratic members of Congress, and numerous former senior DOJ officials, including President Clinton’s former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, who described Director Comey’s conduct as “a kind of reality TV ... antithetical to the interest of justice.” Plainly, removing a director under these circumstances is well within the President’s Constitutional power, and the proposition that he could obstruct a Department of Justice investigation by taking action the Department of Justice said needed to be taken is patently nonsensical. The same is true with respect to the exercise of the President’s Constitutional authority to direct or terminate investigations, which is addressed more fully below.\nAs we have previously expressed, our goal is to facilitate a swift conclusion of any preliminary inquiry into the termination of Mr. Comey, or any other conduct concerning Mr. Comey. For months, the President has suffered under a public and international cloud generated by unsubstantiated stories based on law enforcement leaks, and an unwillingness by Mr. Comey to state publicly what he repeatedly told the President privately about not being under investigation. Almost immediately after Mr. Comey finally informed the public of this fact in his testimony this month, new leaks generated stories that the President was nevertheless now under investigation for firing Mr. Comey. To the extent any inquiry or consideration is being given to this issue, it can be promptly resolved as a matter of law, and we respectfully submit doing so is necessary for important United States’ interests. Continuing uncertainty about whether the sitting President of the United States is being investigated for exercising his inherent Constitutional powers is detrimental to the President’s ability to effectively govern.\nWhile we have confidence that you will come to the same conclusions set forth below, if you conclude a further investigation is warranted, we respectfully request to be advised and be provided the opportunity to raise our statutory and Constitutional objections with the Acting Attorney General.\nUnder the Appointments Clause of Article II of the Constitution, the President has the exclusive authority to appoint federal officials, including the FBI Director. That Constitutional power to appoint federal officials carries with it the power to remove those officials for any reason, except in limited circumstances. No such restrictions have been imposed on the President’s power to remove the FBI Director.\nAs the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) explained in an opinion binding on your office, there is \n Congressionally imposed limitation on the President’s power to remove an FBI Director and it is dubious that Congress could Constitutionally impose any such restriction:\nAs we have previously concluded, the FBI Director is removable at the will of the President. ... No statute purports to restrict the President’s power to remove the Director. Specification of a term of office does not create such a restriction. See Parsons v. United States, 167 U.S. 324, 342 (1897). Nor is there any ground for inferring a restriction. Indeed, tenure protection for an officer with the FBI Director’s broad investigative, administrative, and policymaking responsibilities would raise a serious constitutional question whether Congress had “impede[d] the President’s ability to perform his constitutional duty” to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 691 (1988). The legislative history of the statute specifying the Director’s term, moreover, refutes any idea that Congress intended to limit the President’s removal power. See 122 Cong. Rec. 23,809 (1976)  “Under the provisions of my amendment, there is no limitation on the constitutional power of the President to remove the FBI Director from office within the 10-year term.”) (statement of Sen. Byrd); id. at 23,811  “The FBI Director is a highly placed figure in the executive branch and he can be removed by the President at any time, and for any reason that the President sees fit.”) (statement of Sen. Byrd). Constitutionality of Legislation Extending the Term of the F.B.I. Director, Op. O.L.C. at *3 (June 20, 2011), available at http ://www.justice.gov/file/18356/download.\nThis is a long-standing principle. And Director Comey elected to open his farewell to the FBI staff acknowledging this same Constitutional principle: “I have always believed the President can fire the F.B.I. Director for any reason, or no reason at all.” This view is supported by historical precedent. President Clinton fired FBI Director Sessions in July 1993 at a time when the FBI had multiple open investigations implicating the Clintons, including the Whitewater and the Travel Office investigations, yet there were no claims and certainly no investigations into whether President Clinton’s exercise of his Constitutional power constituted obstruction.\nIt is obvious that the President’s mere exercise of this explicit Constitutional power to appoint and remove officials cannot itself constitute obstruction of justice. And this is certainly clear where, as here, there were ample and notorious reasons to replace Mr. Comey even though the President needed none. Mr. Comey’s high-profile leadership of the FBI during the 2016 Presidential election was controversial and generated widespread bi-partisan criticism from, among others, President Obama and numerous Congressional Democrats and Republicans.\nMost important, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and Attorney General Sessions recommended that Director Comey be removed based on a detailed, three-page memorandum setting forth multiple instances of improper conduct and criticisms from six former Attorneys General and Deputy Attorneys General from both parties. That memorandum concluded “the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a Director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them. Having refused to admit his errors, the Director cannot be expected to implement the necessary corrective actions.” In a letter to the President forwarding DAG Rosenstein’s letter, the Attorney General also concluded “that a fresh start is needed at the leadership of the FBI” and that the Director should be one who “follows faithfully the rules and principles of the Department of Justice.” As he explained in his termination letter to Director Comey, the President concurred that Director Comey was “not able to effectively lead the Bureau. It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.” Based on this record, although not required, to the extent the President required a basis for removing Mr. Comey, there was ample basis for him to do so.\nAlthough irrelevant to the Constitutional issues addressed herein, it is worth noting that many in the media have relied on mischaracterizations of the President’s remarks in a May 11, 2017 interview with Lester Holt, to suggest the President admitted he removed Mr. Comey because of the Russian investigation.\n Relying on that interview, Director Comey also testified that: “I [take] the president at his word that I was fired because of the Russia investigation.”\n However, the President never said any such thing.\nWhat the President actually said was: “I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it. And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself - I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.”\n The President and Mr. Holt then talk over each other for approximately a minute, before the President completes his original thought, making clear that he: (a) wanted the Russian investigation to go forward and “to be absolutely done properly”; (b) removed Mr. Comey in spite of the fact he understood doing so might prolong the investigation; and (c) did so because “I have to do the right thing for the American People. He’s the wrong man for that position”:\nAs far as I’m concerned, I want that thing [the Russia investigation] to be absolutely done properly. When I did this now, I said I probably maybe will confuse people. Maybe I’ll expand that — you know, I’ll lengthen the time because it should be over with. It should — in my opinion, should’ve been over with a long time ago because it — all it is an excuse. But I said to myself I might even lengthen out the investigation. But I have to do the right thing for the American people. He’s the wrong man for that position.\n (emphasis added). Later in the interview, he further noted that he wanted a “simply great FBI director” and fully “expect[ed]” the investigation to continue even without Director Comey.\nPut simply, there is no Constitutionally permissible or factually supportable view under which the President’s removal of Director Comey could constitute obstruction.\nAs a Constitutional matter, the President also possesses the indisputable authority to direct that any executive branch investigation be open or closed because the Constitution provides for a unitary executive with all executive power resting with the President:\nAs head of a unitary executive, the President controls all subordinate officers within the executive branch. The Constitution vests in the President of the United States “The Executive Power,” which means the whole executive power. Because no one individual could personally carry out all executive functions, the President delegates many of these functions to his subordinates in the executive branch. But because the Constitution vests this power in him alone, it follows that he is solely responsible for supervising and directing the activities of his subordinates in carrying out executive functions.\n, 12 Op. O.L.C. 47, 48 (1988).\nWithout question, the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases are core executive functions committed to the sole discretion of the executive branch (and thus ultimately the President). The Executive Branch “has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case.” \n, 418 U.S. 683, 693 (1974); \n, 457 U.S. 368,380 n.11 (1982) (Prosecutorial discretion is a “special province” of the Executive Branch.). “The power to decide when to investigate, and when to prosecute, lies at the core of the Executive’s duty to see to the faithful execution of the laws.” \n, 786 F.2d 1199, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (citations omitted). Thus, the President has exclusive authority to direct that a matter be investigated, or that an investigation be closed without prosecution, or that the subject of an investigation or conviction be pardoned. As the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit succinctly explained:\nThe President may decline to prosecute certain violators of federal law just as the President may pardon certain violators of federal law. The President may decline to prosecute or may pardon because of the President’s own constitutional concerns about a law or because of policy objections to the law, among other reasons.\n, 725 F.3d 255, 262-66 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (citations omitted).\nAgain, while there are various political checks and balances that would inform the President’s exercise of this authority as a prudential matter, and various norms have developed over the years as a result of those checks and balances, none of these diminish the President’s ultimate Constitutional authority over investigations and prosecutions. This has been borne out time and time again in our history. As one outspoken critic of the President, Professor Alan Dershowitz, has explained:\nThroughout United States history — from Presidents Adams to Jefferson to Lincoln to Roosevelt to Kennedy to Obama — presidents have directed (not merely requested) the Justice Department to investigate, prosecute (or not prosecute) specific individuals or categories of individuals. It is only recently that the tradition of an independent Justice Department and FBI has emerged. But traditions, even salutary ones, cannot form the basis of a criminal charge.\nAgain, Mr. Comey agreed in his testimony: “I think as a legal matter, president is the head of the executive branch and could direct, in theory, we have important norms against this, but direct that anybody be investigated or anybody not be investigated. I think he has the legal authority because all of us ultimately report in the executive branch up to the president.”\nThus, as with the removal of the FBI Director, the President cannot obstruct merely by exercising his Constitutional authority to terminate an investigation, and he certainly cannot obstruct by merely expressing a view about an investigation (which the President disputes occurred) instead of terminating it. Again, historical precedent bears this out. No special counsel was appointed and no obstruction investigation was conducted in response to President Obama’s public comments about the FBI investigation into Secretary Clinton’s email server, including his statements in October 2015 that Secretary Clinton “hasn’t jeopardized” classified information; in January 2016, that Secretary Clinton “is not a target” and the investigation was “not headed in the direction of an indictment;” and in April 2016, that Secretary Clinton “has not jeopardized national security” and “would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy.” Of course, a short time after President Obama’s April comments about the lack of intent, Director Comey used that exact basis for unilaterally announcing that “no reasonable prosecutor” would charge Secretary Clinton even though the relevant statute did not even require intent. Yet, no special counsel was appointed and no obstruction investigation was launched.\nEven ignoring the President’s Constitutional authority, it is nevertheless clear that none of the subject conduct constitutes obstruction even accepting Director Comey’s account of events, which the President does not. The only statute that could even theoretically be implicated on the alleged facts is 18 U.S.C. § 1505, and the elements for obstruction simply cannot be met.\nFirst, there was no “pending proceeding” within the meaning of § 1505 regarding the investigation of Gen. Flynn. Under § 1505, a “pending proceeding” is limited only to agencies with rule-making or adjudicative authority.\n The investigation of Gen. Flynn is being conducted by the FBI, which possesses only investigative authority, not adjudicative ; it cannot conduct “proceedings “ within the meaning of§ 1505.\n Courts have explained it this way:\n[T]he meaning of “proceeding” in § 1505 must be limited to actions of an agency which relate to some matter within the scope of the rulemaking or adjudicative power vested in the agency by law. Since the F.B.I. has no rulemaking or adjudicative powers regarding the subject matter of this indictment, its investigation was not a “proceeding” within the meaning of the statute.\n, 511 F. Supp. 453, 455 (W.D. Ky. 1981) (noting government’s lack of precedent or legal support for assertion to the contrary).\nSome have picked up on the language in the DOJ manual and cited other sources for the proposition that a “pending proceeding \n an informal investigation by an executive agency.”\n But, as constitutional law professor Elizabeth Price Foley notes:\nIn the almost 120 years since Section 1505 and its predecessor have been on the books, no court appears to have ever held that an ongoing F.B.I. investigation qualifies as a “pending proceeding” within the meaning of the statute. Instead, Section 1505 applies to court or court-like proceedings to enforce federal law.\nThe House Judiciary Committee reports affirm this reading, noting that attempts to obstruct a criminal investigation “before a proceeding has been initiated” do not fall within the scope of the statute.\n Furthermore, the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual makes clear that “investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are not section 1505 proceedings.”\n And the Justice Department itself has acknowledged as much to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. \n, 335 Fed. Appx. 338, 342 (4th Cir. 2009) (Government conceded that criminal investigation by FBI or DEA was not pending proceeding within the scope of 18 U.S.C. § 1505, and requested defendant’s conviction on that count be vacated). The FBI’s investigation of Gen. Flynn is therefore not within the scope of§ 1505. As the \n Court explained, “[u]nder our system of separation of powers, a criminal investigatory agency, in contradistinction to an administrative or regulatory agency, has no power to engage in rulemaking or adjudication.” \n, 511 F. Supp. at 455.\nNot only is it clear that an FBI investigation is not a “pending proceeding” for purposes of § 1505, under the statute, the President would have had to have knowledge that there was a pending proceeding. Since the FBI’s investigation at issue is not a “pending proceeding” under § 1505,\n it is therefore impossible for the President to have been made aware of said pending proceeding. For this reason alone, § 1505 \n to the President’s conduct or statements. Culpability under § 1505 is a legal impossibility. The President should not be investigated for violating a criminal statute that cannot apply to the alleged (albeit disputed)facts. We trust your office would have no desire to do so.\nSecond, even assuming § 1505 could apply to the President, Comey’s own characterization of the President’s comments fail to show that the President possessed the intent to obstruct the proceedings which is required by the statute.\n Under § 1505, intent to obstruct requires the defendant to “act purposefully,” meaning that he must know his actions are likely to influence the proceedings.\n Most courts agree that this “knowledge” element is satisfied by acting with the knowledge that his actions would have the “natural and probable” effect of interfering with the proceedings.\n Moreover, these actions must also be done “corruptly,” meaning they must be conducted with an improper purpose.\nIn this case, the only evidence of relevant Presidential action alleged by Comey is that the President expressed to Comey that General Flynn “is a good guy” and “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.”\n The President, of course, has categorically denied saying “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” Of course, even assuming, arguendo, that he used such words, it still is merely a deliberative statement by the President that, in its proper and obvious context, cannot be reasonably construed as a threat. Moreover, the fact that Comey remained in his position after this alleged conversation, continued the investigation otherwise unimpeded, and brought this particular statement up \n he was terminated in disgrace refutes any suggestion that he viewed the President’s statement as a threat.\nAgain, while not relevant to the constitutional and statutory arguments discussed in this letter, we briefly discuss these facts as they have also been the subject of much misrepresentation.\nAccording to Director Comey, the President said the following at a February 14, 2017, meeting:\nThe President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, “He is a good guy and has been through a lot.” He repeated that Flynn hadn’t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” I replied only that “he is a good guy.” (In fact, I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he was a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI.) I did not say I would “let this go.”\nWhile acknowledging that the President only said “hope,” Director Comey said he took it as a direction:\n He did not direct you to let it go?\n Not in his words, no.\n He did not order you to let it go? \n Again, those words are not an order. ... The reason I keep saying his words is I took it as a direction. \n Right. \n I mean, this is a president of the United States with me alone saying I hope this. I took it as, this is what he wants me to do. I didn’t obey that, but that’s the way I took it. \n You may have taken it as a direction but that’s not what he said. \n Correct.\nMoreover, according to Director Comey’s testimony, although Director Comey did not agree “to let this go,” and although the investigation of Mr. Flynn continued, he does not contend that the President ever raised the matter with him again, and the President denies he ever said he “hoped” Comey could “let it go” in words or substance. Nor did anyone from the White House, or anyone else acting on the President’s behalf, ever contact him about the Flynn investigation.\nWhile Director Comey testified that the President pressed him several times, according to his testimony that “pressing” had nothing to do with the Flynn investigation, but rather with the President’s completely proper and reasonable request that the Director say publicly what he had said privately three times, namely, that the President was not himself under investigation. The President made clear his reason for this request: according to Director Comey, the President explained  “the cloud’ was getting in the way of his ability to do his job.”\n As Director Comey himself testified in a discussion with Senator Reed, there would have been nothing improper about Director Comey publicly making the factually accurate statement he had repeatedly made privately to the President and Congress — namely, that the President was not under investigation.\n Indeed Director Comey testified publicly to precisely this fact less than two months later. Yet, Director Comey declined to do so at the time despite the President’s repeated requests.\nIt is also clear that at the time of their conversations, Director Comey did not construe the President’s alleged remarks as an effort to obstruct justice. He did not at any time direct the FBI to commence an obstruction investigation. Although the comments were allegedly made on February 14, 2017, according to Director Comey, the President was still not under investigation when the Director was removed from office almost two months later. Deputy Director McCabe also testified that he was not aware of any pressure on the FBI regarding any investigation.\n All of this indicates that Comey did not report his currently post-termination view to his Deputy at the time, nor did Director Comey report any concerns of alleged obstruction to his superiors at the Justice Department.\nWe appreciate the opportunity to address these matters. We remain committed to working with your office to facilitate a swift and thorough review which we hope will lead to the conclusion we have clearly demonstrated, \n, that constitutionally and as a matter of law, there is no basis for any investigation to include the conduct of the President of the United States.\nRespectfully submitted,\nMarc E. Kasowitz\nCounsel to the President\n It is not necessary to go so far as to contend that no conduct by a President could ever amount to obstruction of justice. All that is necessary here is to understand that the set of facts alleged in this situation cannot amount to obstruction of justice. We also note that, a President has no constitutional authority to bribe witnesses or suborn perjury and any such conduct would of course be subject to the relevant statutes. But such conduct has not even remotely been alleged against the President. And, we leave aside for now the well-established rule that a sitting President cannot be indicted, as opposed to impeached, for any crime (A Silting President ‘s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, Op. O.L.C. (Oct. 16, 2000)). In sum, it remains clear that the President’s exercise of his constitutional authority at issue here — to terminate an FBI Director and to close investigations — cannot constitutionally constitute obstruction of justice.\n  Devlin Barrett & Philip Rucker, Trump Said He was Thinking of Russia Controversy When He Decided to Fire Comey, WASH.

Bush, Bill Clinton and George Bush.\nIf Mr. Trump’s remaining nominees are confirmed, women and nonwhites will hold six of 24 cabinet or cabinet-level positions. This includes R. Alexander Acosta, \n. Mr. Acosta would be the only Hispanic member of Mr. Trump’s cabinet.\n“Donald Trump is rolling back the clock on diversity in the cabinet,” said Paul Light, a professor at New York University’s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.\nThose six members will also be in some of the lowest-ranking positions. None of them are in the so-called inner cabinet, the four positions in place \n: the attorney general and the secretaries of state, Treasury and defense (formerly called the secretary of war).\nThe cabinet members below are listed in order of \n. The inner cabinet comes after the vice president, House speaker and president pro tempore of the Senate.\nSome positions, such as the United Nations ambassador and the Office of Management and Budget director, are given cabinet-level rank by individual presidents but are not traditionally considered part of the cabinet.\nHistorically, white women were named to inner-cabinet positions before nonwhite men and women. \n served as secretary of state during Mr. Clinton’s second term, and \n served as attorney general during both of his terms.\nThe first black person to run the State Department was \n in 2001. \n, nominated by Mr. Obama in 2009, was the first black attorney general.\n“Secretary of Treasury and secretary of defense have never been a woman or a person of color,” said Anne O’Connell, professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. Mr. Trump’s choices continue that pattern.\nNonwhite women\nWhite women\nNonwhite men\nThe few women and minorities in his cabinet occupy lower-ranking positions.\n▪ \n, who was \n to lead the Transportation Department, is from Taiwan. She previously served as secretary of labor during both terms of George W.

She is the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment.\n▪ \n, who is black, was \n to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n▪ \n, was \n to lead the Labor Department, after Andrew F. Puzder withdrew his name from consideration in February. Mr. Acosta previously served as assistant attorney general for the civil rights division of the Justice Department.\nDr. Light, an expert on the presidential appointment process, said that having diversity in the cabinet became standard as nonwhites and women moved up the ranks in politics. “That happened over time, but presidents also became more sensitive to it,” he said.\nDuring his first presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton said he would have a cabinet that “\n.” In the weeks before his inauguration, he was criticized by women’s organizations for not selecting women fast enough, but he ultimately appointed more women and African-Americans than his predecessors.\n“They come from diverse backgrounds, and we will all be better and stronger for that diversity,” \n in 1992. “I can say with pride that I believe this cabinet and these other appointees represent the best in America.”\nThe first cabinets of George W. Bush and Mr. Obama were both noted for their diversity. In Mr. Bush’s initial administration, 45 percent of the cabinet and cabinet-level officials were women or nonwhite men. In Mr. Obama’s first cabinet, that figure was 64 percent.\nThe nation’s first female cabinet member was Secretary of Labor \n, who was \n in 1933. Since then, six more women have served as labor secretary, more than any other cabinet position. Mr. Obama, George W. Bush and George Bush all began their presidencies with women running the Labor Department.\n became the \n when he ran the Commerce Department at the end of Mr. Clinton’s second term. He later served as secretary of transportation in George W. Bush’s first cabinet. \n, who served under President Lyndon B.

Exxon received the right to look for oil in the Black and Kara Seas alongside Rosneft, in return for giving the Russian company minority stakes in Exxon projects in Texas, the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere.\nThe deal cemented an alliance between Mr. Tillerson and Igor Sechin, the executive chairman of Rosneft and former deputy prime minister of Russia. Mr. Sechin is a close ally of Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and both share a past as Soviet intelligence agents.\nIn 2014, Exxon’s deal was put on ice after the Obama administration imposed sanctions on Russia for annexing Crimea. In addition the Treasury Department, citing his “utter loyalty to Vladimir Putin,” \n, barring him from traveling to the United States, freezing his assets and forbidding personal business transactions with American citizens.\nMr. Sechin lamented the travel ban imposed against him in 2014, saying at a \n that he regretted not being able to “ride the roads of the United States on motorcycles with Tillerson.”\nIn June, Mr. Tillerson attended a major state-sponsored economic forum in St. Petersburg, Russia, that had been shunned by American executives since the sanctions were imposed, causing the \n to say that participation in the forum “sends the wrong message about the acceptability of Russia’s actions.”\nIf the 2014 sanctions are lifted by the Trump administration, the Exxon-Rosneft partnership would be able to resume oil exploration in the Arctic.\nOn Wednesday, in response to a question at his Senate confirmation hearings, Mr. Tillerson said, “We need to move Russia from being an adversary always, to a partner at times.”\nAccording to \n, the company is the largest oil producer in this \n, known to oil executives as the “Kuwait of Africa,” because of its sizable offshore oil deposits.\nEquatorial Guinea is also one of the poorest countries in the world despite the oil boom having \n since the mid 1990s. The ruling family has amassed property in Europe, Brazil and the United States while the majority of the population subsists on less than $2 a day.\nIn 2004, United States federal auditors \n in Washington where Exxon and other oil companies had deposited hundreds of millions of dollars in payments for the use of Equatorial Guinea’s oil fields.\nRecords of the bank’s accounts show large deposits, in increments as high as $250,000, from American oil companies into the accounts of government officials and their relatives.

His father appointed him vice president last year.\nUnder Mr. Tillerson, Exxon signed a major new oil exploration agreement with Equatorial Guinea in 2015. In a \n, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, the minister of mines, industry and energy, and another son of the president, said that the deal “signifies the start of a new adventure between old acquaintances and is expected to be as successful as the first one.”\nThe company had operated in Venezuela for decades, but in 2007, shortly after Mr. Tillerson stepped into the C.E.O. job, Hugo Chávez, who was the country’s president, said he would \n with ExxonMobil, after pressuring other foreign oil companies to renegotiate as well.\nExxon did not agree to the changes in terms, and the Venezuelan government seized its assets in the country.\nIn a 2013 \n, Mr. Tillerson said that Mr. Chavez had “changed the contracts and invited us to either accept the new contracts or to leave the country, and I accepted his invitation to leave the country.”\nMr. Tillerson continued: “We have been in and out of Venezuela before. We were in Venezuela. We left Venezuela, we went back and we left again.”\nExxon sued the Venezuelan government for seizing its assets, winning a case before the World Bank’s international arbitration court in 2014, but Venezuela was ordered to pay only about one-tenth of what Exxon said the assets were worth.\nExxonMobil has operated in Angola for more than 20 years, and it began production at new offshore wells under Mr. Tillerson’s leadership in 2012 and 2015. The country is Africa’s second-largest oil producer, and \n constitutes \n of the country’s exports.\nIn Angola, the state-owned Sonangol authorizes all exploration and drilling activity.

The country was a newborn state at the time, having only recently unified the populous, republican north with a smaller Marxist government in the south.\nMr. Tillerson was credited with playing hardball with the negotiating team of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, refusing to change the terms of the deal when the government wanted to alter it on the night before he was to return to Texas. Mr. Tillerson \n at one point, throwing a five-inch-thick book across the room.\nThis is the sort of uncompromising international dealmaking that Mr. Trump might value in a secretary of state.\nIn October 2001, officials from the World Bank, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Petronas of Malaysia joined the presidents of Chad and Cameroon in a ceremony celebrating the start of one of the largest oil infrastructure projects in African history: a $4.2 billion, 665-mile pipeline to carry crude oil from the floodplains of southern Chad, through Cameroon and to the Atlantic coast.\n“I view the Chad project as a clean sheet of paper,” \n, at the time an executive vice president. “We have the opportunity to put things in place perhaps the way you’d like to see them carried out from the very beginning.”\nExxon had a presence in Chad since 1988, but the agreement, organized by the oil companies and the World Bank and signed into law by President Idriss Déby Itno in 1999, pledged that 80 percent of its oil revenue would go to social development in education, health, agriculture and infrastructure, and another 10 percent would be kept in a “future generations” fund.\nThe agreement was seen as an aspirational example, in which the oil companies could enhance the security of their drilling operations and the political stability of the country by ensuring that oil revenue would help to raise the living standards of Chad’s impoverished citizens.\nBut the pledge was not honored. During Mr. Tillerson’s tenure as C.E.O. in 2008, the World Bank decided to \n that had helped finance the African pipeline, after a report found that much of the money had been wasted and embezzled.\nThe World Bank \n saying that “over the years, Chad failed to comply with the key requirements of this agreement,” and that “once again, the government did not allocate adequate resources critical for poverty reduction.”\nTop photograph by J.

Meanwhile, American officials will conduct a review into screening procedures in place to prevent threats.\nWhile new applicants will be admitted on a case-by-case basis, travelers from countries that do not provide sufficient information for screening by the end of the review may still be barred from entering the United States.\nThe new ban \n, though Iraqi nationals seeking admission will be subject to additional scrutiny. Some of Mr. Trump’s foreign policy advisors argued for the country’s removal, citing the country’s role in fighting the Islamic State.\nIn legal challenges to the original ban, plaintiffs cited a law that says the government cannot act arbitrarily or without supportive evidence.\nTwo weeks after the federal appeals court hearing, a Department of Homeland Security report was revealed to have \n that citizens from the targeted countries posed a unique threat. However, Homeland Security officials argued that the report did not paint a full picture.\nThe new ban \n like temporary, non-immigrant visas for students and workers. Students with valid F, M or J visas will be allowed. The original ban also affected current visa holders who would normally be allowed to travel and re-enter the country.\nDuring the rollout of the first ban, many visa holders were stuck abroad or detained in American airports. Later, a State Department official said that “fewer than 60,000” visas had been provisionally revoked. Several judges who issued injunctions against the original order raised concerns that due process rights were being violated.\nThere were nearly 65,000 nonimmigrant, temporary visits by citizens from these six countries in the 2015 fiscal year, including:\nVisitors, business travelers\n49,412 entries in 2015\nPeople visiting the U.S. for recreational or business purposes on non-immigrant travel visas like B-1 or B-2.\nStudents\n12,205 entries in 2015\nInternational students (and their families) enrolled in U.S. programs on non-immigrant visas like F-1, J-1 and M-1.\nTemporary workers\n883 entries in 2015\nEmployees (and their families) on non-immigrant work visas like H-1B for specialty workers and H-2B for agricultural workers.\nFiancés of U.S. citizens\n669 entries in 2015\nTemporary visas for fiancés of U.S. citizens and for spouses and children of U.S. citizens or green card holders who have pending immigrant visas.\nLike the original order, the new ban also applies to people from the six countries newly arriving on immigrant visas, which are issued based on employment or family status. People issued immigrant visas become legal permanent residents on arrival in the United States and are issued a green card soon after.\nIn 2015, green cards were issued to 31,258 people from these six countries. In general, about half of recent new legal permanent residents are new arrivals to the country, and the other half had their status adjusted after living in the United States.\nThe ban on all refugees to the United States is still set at 120 days. \n but now fall under the general ban. After the 120 days, the administration will determine which countries they will reinstate admissions from. Syrians made up the \n to the United States in 2016.\nIn another change, \n once the program is reinstated. Although the original order did not explicitly mention Christians as a minority religion that would have been given preference, Mr. Trump said that was what he intended, prompting challenges claiming religious-based discrimination.\nThe order still allows case-by-case exceptions for some refugees. During the week when the initial refugee ban was in effect, \n who were admitted on a case-by-case basis were Muslim, compared with a weekly average of 45 percent in 2016. Only two refugees were allowed in from the seven originally targeted countries. Refugees already granted asylum will be allowed.\nThe new ban also still \n in half, capping it at 50,000 people for the 2017 fiscal year, down from the 110,000 ceiling put in place under President Barack Obama.\nThe new order explicitly says that \n In the original order, green card holders were not explicitly cited as exempt, leading to uncertainty at airports. The administration later clarified that they were not affected.\nFrom 1999 to 2015, 2.6 percent of new legal permanent residents were from the six affected countries.\nThe ban still does not apply to U.S. citizens, or to dual nationals who enter the United States presenting their passport from a country not under the ban. During the rollout of the original order, it was unclear whether dual nationals from the targeted countries were allowed.\nPeople on certain types of diplomatic or government visas are also still exempted from the ban. Nearly 1,500 admissions from the six countries were made on these visas in 2015:\nDiplomats\nDiplomats (and their families) on visas like A-1\nGovernment officials\nRepresentatives of foreign governments or international organizations holding G-1, G-2, G-3 or G-4 visas\nVisitors to the United Nations\nPeople with C-2 visas to travel to the United Nations\nNATO officials\nOfficials (and their families) on North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas\nThe new ban eliminated references to support for the Constitution and other beliefs. It also includes details about why the six countries were selected, and a 10-day delay for implementation. The original ban was effective immediately after Mr. Trump signed it, causing significant confusion at airports across the country. The delay was likely also included to remove the potential for due process challenges.\nSources: Department of Homeland Security; Migration Policy Institute\nAdvertisement"},
